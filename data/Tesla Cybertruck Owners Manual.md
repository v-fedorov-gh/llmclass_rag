# Touchscreen

NOTE: Throughout this Owner's Manual, the front touchscreen is referred to as the "touchscreen" whereas the rear touchscreen is referred to as the "rear touchscreen".

WARNING: Always pay attention to road and traffic conditions when driving. To minimize driver distraction and ensure the safety of vehicle occupants as well as other road users, avoid using the touchscreen to adjust settings while the vehicle is in motion.

Use the touchscreen to control many features that, in traditional vehicles, are controlled using physical buttons (for example, adjusting the cabin heating and air conditioning, headlights, etc.). You also use the touchscreen to control media, navigate, use entertainment features, and customize Cybertruck to suit your preferences. For hands-free access to common touchscreen controls, use voice commands (see Voice Commands on page 25).

If the touchscreen is unresponsive or demonstrates unusual behavior, you can restart it (see Restarting the Touchscreen on page 10).

CAUTION: Do not apply a screen protector on the touchscreen. Doing so can result in unintended inputs to the touchscreen (phantom inputs), delayed response or unresponsiveness to touches, electrostatic discharge which can damage the touchscreen, etc. Any damage caused by installing a screen protector is not covered by the warranty.

The following shows the touchscreen while Cybertruck is parked.

NOTE: Illustrations are provided to improve conceptual understanding only. Depending on vehicle options, software version, market region and regional and language settings, the details displayed on the screen will differ.

[An image of the Cybertruck's touchscreen interface is shown, with numbered callouts for different sections]

1. Navigation: Find or navigate to a destination (see Maps and Navigation on page 163).
2. Status bar: This area on the top of the touchscreen displays the time of day, the outside temperature, and more (see Top Status Bar Icons on page 8).
3. Drive mode strip: Use to shift into Park, Reverse, or Drive. Swipe right from the upper-left side of the screen to display the drive mode strip (see Shifting on page 73).

NOTE: To shift into Neutral, open Controls, then press and hold the Neutral icon.

See Popup Messages and Vehicle Alerts on page 9 for more information about alert popups on your vehicle's touchscreen.

## Driving Status

When Cybertruck is driving (or ready to drive), the touchscreen shows your current driving status and real-time visualization of the road as detected by the Autopilot components (see Cameras on page 27). The visualization automatically zooms in and out to better utilize touchscreen space and inform you when a vehicle is detected in your blind spot.

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | PRND /////// 251 mi |
| 2 | Currently selected drive mode |
| 3 | 63 (Driving speed) |
| 4 | Headlight indicator |
| 5 | Visualization of vehicle ahead |
| 6 | Visualization of your vehicle |

The touchscreen also shows the following:

1. Total estimated driving distance (or energy) available. You can toggle between driving distance and percentage of Battery energy remaining by touching the displayed value. You can also change how energy is displayed by touching Controls > Display > Energy Display. When anticipating when you need to charge, use range estimates as a general guideline only.

2. Currently selected drive mode: Park, Reverse, Neutral, or Drive (see Shifting on page 73).

3. Driving speed.

# Vehicle Status

4. The speed limit that is currently being detected by Speed Assist (see Speed Assist on page 147). The icon associated with the detected speed limit reflects the style of speed limit signs used in your market region.

   NOTE: A blue outline may appear around the speed limit icon to notify that you are above the speed limit.

5. Other cars detected on the road (as applicable).

6. Your Cybertruck. Colored lines radiate from the image of your Cybertruck as objects are detected (other motorists, guard rails, etc.). The location of the lines correspond to the location of the detected object. The color of the lines (white, yellow, orange, or red) represents the object's proximity to Cybertruck, with white being the farthest and red being very close and requiring your immediate attention. See Lane Assist on page 141.

⚠️ WARNING: Pay attention to important alert messages that display at the bottom of the vehicle status area of the touchscreen. Ignoring these messages can result in serious injury or death.

⚠️ WARNING: Although the touchscreen shows surrounding traffic, some vehicles may not be displayed. Never rely on the detected displayed vehicles to determine if a vehicle is present (for example, in your blind spot). Always use your mirrors and perform shoulder checks.

Overview                                                                                                                               19

# Interior Electronics

In addition to storage compartments and cup holders (see Interior Storage on page 56), the Cybertruck interior supports various electronics such as an RFID transmitter that reads key cards (see Keys on page 30), USB-C ports, wireless phone chargers, a power outlet in the center console, and a power outlet below the rear touchscreen.

NOTE: Power is available when the vehicle is in use or detects that a user is present. A user is considered present when a person is in the driver seat or interacts with the touchscreen. Leaving an accessory plugged in does not deplete the low voltage battery.

## USB-C Ports

Cybertruck has four USB ports.

There are three USB-C ports in the center console, each of which can provide up to 65W of power:

- One USB-C port is located in the front compartment of the center console. This port can be used to charge a USB-C device.

[Image of center console compartment with an arrow pointing to a USB-C port]

- Two USB-C ports are located below the rear touchscreen and can be used to charge USB-C devices.

[Image of rear touchscreen area with an arrow pointing to USB-C ports]

NOTE: Use USB 3.0 compliant cables to connect a device to a USB-C port. Using non-compliant cables may result in slower charging, connection problems, or degraded performance.

NOTE: If all three USB-C ports are in use at the same time, power to each port will be reduced.

CAUTION: Do not use the USB-C ports to power a device with a power rating that exceeds the limits listed above.

There is also a USB-A port in the glovebox. This port is equipped with a USB-A flash drive. This port can be used to play media from a phone or USB-A drive (see Playing Media from Devices on page 169) or to save Sentry Mode and Dashcam video footage.

[Image of glovebox area with an arrow pointing to a USB-A port]

NOTE: Do not connect multiple devices using a USB hub. This can prevent connected devices from charging or from being recognized by Media Player, Sentry Mode, Dashcam, etc.

## Wireless Phone Chargers

Wireless phone chargers are integrated into the front console, providing up to 15W of power to charge Qi-enabled phones. To charge your phone, place it on one of the two charge pads. The phone must be in direct contact with the wireless charger. Your device may feel warm while charging, but this is a normal effect of inductive charging.

CAUTION: Before you charge, remove any objects (coins, keys, metal objects, etc.) between the phone and charger, as well as any NFC cards (for example, the vehicle key card, credit cards, or hotel key) placed on or behind the phone (like with integrated phone cases). Damage to NFC cards can occur when you charge the phone without first removing the card.

NOTE: The wireless phone chargers are in the same location as the key card readers (see Key Card on page 30).

# Interior Electronics

NOTE: Two 120V power outlets are also located in the cargo bed, in addition to a 240V power outlet (see Cargo Bed Outlets on page 23).

To access the front power outlet, open the front compartment of the center console (see Interior Storage on page 56). The power outlet is located on the front wall of the compartment:

[Image of the front compartment of the center console showing a power outlet]

When placed on the wireless charger, your phone charges whenever the vehicle is powered on (the touchscreen is on and you are in the vehicle). Your phone does not charge when you leave the vehicle unless a feature, such as Sentry Mode, is enabled.

NOTE: The phone must be in direct contact with the wireless charger. If you place objects between the phone and the charger (for example, credit cards, key cards, coins, keys, metal objects, etc.), or if your phone case is too large or is made of metal, the wireless charger may not work. Try removing the phone from its case before placing it on the charger.

NOTE: The wireless phone charger does not charge if the vehicle's high voltage Battery is discharged.

## Interior Power Outlets

The Cybertruck center console is equipped with two NEMA 5-20 120V power outlets capable of providing up to 20A combined. To enable power to the outlets, touch Controls > Outlets & Mods. Touch Enable Cabin Outlets on Entry to enable them by default when you enter Cybertruck.

If an outlet is not providing power as expected, see Troubleshooting AC Outlets on page 23.

NOTE: The 120V power outlets provide 20A maximum draw between both outlets. If multiple devices are plugged in and drawing power at the same time, power to each device may be reduced or interrupted.

NOTE: Power to AC outlets may be disabled in very low ambient temperatures.

NOTE: Power to AC outlets is disabled when an AC charging cable is connected to Cybertruck even if the vehicle is not actively charging.

Power to AC outlets is still available when Cybertruck is DC charging (while Supercharging, for example). See Charging Instructions on page 176.

The rear power outlet is located below the rear touchscreen:

[Image of the rear power outlet located below the rear touchscreen]

NOTE: To have the cabin outlets continue supplying power even when Cybertruck is not occupied, touch Controls > Outlets & Mods and enable Keep On Cabin and Bed Outlets (see Keep On Cabin and Bed Outlets on page 23). You can also enable CyberTent Mode and turn on outlets to keep them on when camping (see CyberTent Mode on page 23).

CAUTION: Leaving a device plugged in depletes the high voltage Battery. Power to the outlets shuts off when the capacity of the high voltage Battery is very low.

CAUTION: Damage to a device or data loss (such as from a laptop or external drive) due to a sudden loss of power is not covered by the warranty.

# Cargo Bed Outlets

Your Cybertruck has three AC power outlets located in the cargo bed.

To access the outlets:

1. Open the tailgate (see Cargo Bed on page 60).
2. Locate the outlet cover on the left side of the bed.
3. Pull the left side of the panel to open the cover.

The outlet cover must be open in order for the outlets to provide power.

![Image showing the cargo bed outlets of the Cybertruck]

1. 120V power outlets (20A maximum draw, combined)
2. 240V power outlet (40A maximum draw, combined)

The 120V power outlets provide a maximum of 20A across both cargo bed outlets. This is independent from the 120V outlets in the cabin which also provide a maximum of 20A across both cabin outlets (see Interior Power Outlets on page 21). It is possible to pull 20A from the cabin and 20A from the cargo bed at the same time. All AC power outlets combined (120V cabin, 120V cargo bed, and the 240V cargo bed outlet) are limited to a combined maximum of 40A. If multiple devices are plugged in and drawing power at the same time, power to each device may be reduced or interrupted.

The outlets stop providing power when Cybertruck is no longer occupied (when you leave the vehicle and close the doors).

To enable power to the outlets, touch Controls > Outlets & Mods on the touchscreen. From here you can toggle power to all AC outlets and each power feed (see Connecting Accessories to the 48V Power Feeds on page 212). While the outlets are supplying power, the touchscreen shows the amount of power being used.

You can also enable power to the outlets and power feeds using the mobile app.

NOTE: Leaving a device plugged in depletes the high voltage Battery. Even if nothing is plugged in, the outlets draw small amounts of power from the Battery whenever they are enabled. When the charge level of the high voltage Battery is very low, power to the outlets shuts off and a message is displayed on the touchscreen. Leaving a device plugged in does not deplete the low voltage battery.

⚠️ CAUTION: Do not use the AC outlets to power a device with a power rating that exceeds the limits listed above.

## Keep On Cabin and Bed Outlets

If you want the outlets to continue supplying power even when the vehicle is not occupied, touch Controls > Outlets & Mods and enable Keep On Cabin and Bed Outlets. After 12 hours, or once the high voltage Battery has less than 5% remaining energy, the outlets shut off. Keep On Cabin and Bed Outlets is automatically enabled whenever you turn on the outlets using the mobile app.

## CyberTent Mode

After installing the CyberTent, enable CyberTent Mode for optimal comfort. CyberTent Mode:

- Levels the suspension.
- Opens the tonneau cover and keeps it open by disabling the switches.
- Displays controls to adjust the front and rear lights.
- Allows outlets to be kept on indefinitely.

NOTE: Using CyberTent Mode and keeping the outlets or lights on may increase power usage.

- Disables walk-away lock.

NOTE: It is your responsibility to ensure the vehicle is appropriately locked or attended to at all times.

To enable, touch Controls > Outlets & Mods > CyberTent Mode. Cybertruck cannot be driven while CyberTent Mode is enabled.

## Overload Capability

The AC outlets on Cybertruck are all capable of providing additional surge current to start almost all devices (such as power tools, motors, and compressors) up to 110LRA.

## Troubleshooting AC Outlets

AC outlets may be disabled in the following scenarios:

- Very low ambient temperatures.
- When an AC charging cable is connected to Cybertruck even if the vehicle is not actively charging.
- The high voltage Battery does not have enough charge.
---
# Cargo Bed Outlets

- GFCI or overcurrent detection has been tripped.

If one or more outlets unexpectedly stops providing power, first ensure that you have enabled power to the outlets (touch Controls > Outlets & Mods) and that the high voltage Battery has enough remaining charge.

Each power outlet in Cybertruck is equipped with overcurrent detection and a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI), which interrupts the power supply to an outlet if an issue is detected, such as a current leakage. In this case, the outlets will turn off. Overcurrent detection may happen if multiple devices plugged in at once draw too much power from the AC power outlets.

⚠️ CAUTION: Use only "UL" Listed devices with the AC power outlets in Cybertruck.

⚠️ CAUTION: Damage to a device or data loss (such as from a laptop or external drive) due to a sudden loss of power is not covered by the warranty.

If an outlet is still not providing power, the GFCI or overcurrent detection may have been tripped. When an outlet is faulted, an option to reset the outlets becomes available. To reset:

1. Disconnect all devices from all AC outlets (three outlets in the cargo bed and two in the center console).
2. Touch Controls > Outlets & Mods > Reset.
3. Reconnect devices and re-enable power to the outlets by touching Controls > Outlets & Mods > AC Outlets.

NOTE: Power to AC outlets is still available when Cybertruck is DC charging (while Supercharging, for example). See Charging Instructions on page 176.

## Warnings and Cautions

⚠️ CAUTION: Always check each outlet for damage before use.

⚠️ CAUTION: Keep the outlet cover closed when the cargo bed outlets are not in use.

⚠️ CAUTION: Keep the outlet cover closed when Cybertruck is AC charging, especially in wet weather. AC charging may be disabled if moisture enters one of the outlets.

⚠️ CAUTION: Damage to Cybertruck caused by an external device that is plugged in to an outlet is not covered by the warranty.

⚠️ CAUTION: Use caution when driving Cybertruck while devices are plugged into the cargo bed outlets. Ensure that all objects in the cargo bed are properly secured (see Securing Cargo on page 62).

⚠️ WARNING: A power outlet and a device's plug can become hot. Use caution when unplugging a device.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not insert any objects into the outlets other than electrical plugs. Treat the outlets on Cybertruck the same as you would any other outlet, and take care to ensure proper handling. Misusing outlets can cause serious injury.

⚠️ WARNING: Protect the cargo bed outlets from moisture, water, and foreign objects at all times. If you see a foreign object in an outlet, or if the outlets appear corroded or damaged, do not use them.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not use the cargo bed outlets if they are wet or covered in snow.

⚠️ WARNING: If rain falls while an accessory is plugged in and drawing power from the cargo bed outlets, do not allow rain water to run along the length of charge cable, causing the outlets to become wet.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not connect a power source (such as a solar panel or external battery) to a cargo bed outlet.

⚠️ WARNING: As with any power outlet, do not leave children unattended near the cargo bed outlets and ensure the outlet cover is closed when the outlets are not in use.

# Cameras

Your Cybertruck includes the following components that actively monitor the surrounding area:

[Image of Cybertruck top view with numbered camera locations]

1. A camera is mounted on the tailgate.
2. A camera is mounted in each door pillar.
3. Two cameras are mounted to the windshield above the rear view mirror.
4. A camera is mounted above each front wheel.
5. A camera is mounted above the grille on the front bumper.

Swipe up or down to switch between the rear and front camera views.

The camera app opens automatically when you shift into Reverse.

## Rear-Facing Camera

Cybertruck is equipped with a rear-facing camera mounted on the tailgate.

[Image of Cybertruck rear view with camera location highlighted]

## Viewing Camera Feeds

The Camera app shows the views from the side cameras, rear-facing camera, and front-facing camera. To open the Camera app, you can either:

- Open the app launcher and touch the Camera app.

[Image of hexagonal Camera app icon]

- Touch the camera icon on the right side of the steering wheel.

[Image of steering wheel controls with camera icon highlighted]

Whenever you shift into Reverse, the touchscreen displays the view from the rear-facing camera. Lines show your driving path based on the position of the steering wheel. These lines adjust as you move the steering wheel. The tailgate must be fully closed in order to see the rear view and lines on the display.

You can choose to always show the rear view camera feed when the tonneau cover is closed by touching Controls > Display > Rear View Camera > Auto.

If a black screen appears on the touchscreen instead of the rear view camera feed when in Reverse, use the rear view mirrors and ensure your surroundings are safe before continuing to Reverse. If inoperability of the rear view camera persists, try restarting the touchscreen (see Restarting the Touchscreen on page 10). If the camera feed still shows as a black screen after that, use the mobile app to schedule a service appointment.

⚠️ WARNING: Never depend on the cameras to inform you if the area around you is free of objects and/or people. The cameras may not detect objects or barriers that can potentially cause damage or injury. In addition, several external factors can reduce the performance of the cameras, including a dirty or obstructed lens. Therefore, depending on the cameras to determine if Cybertruck is approaching an obstruction can result in damage to the vehicle and/or objects and can potentially cause serious injury. Always inspect the area with your own eyes. When reversing, perform shoulder checks and use all mirrors. Use the cameras for guidance purposes only. It is not intended to replace your own direct visual checks and is not a substitute for careful driving.

Overview 27

# Cameras

## Front-Facing Camera

Your Cybertruck is equipped with a front-facing camera located above the grille on the front fascia.

[Image of the front-facing camera on a Cybertruck]

To display the view from the front-facing camera at any time, open the app launcher and touch the Camera app or touch the camera icon on the right side of the steering wheel. Swipe up or down to switch between the rear, front, and side camera views.

⚠️ WARNING: Never depend on the camera to inform you if the area around you is free of objects and/or people. The camera may not detect objects or barriers that can potentially cause damage or injury. In addition, several external factors can reduce the performance of the cameras, including a dirty or obstructed lens. Therefore, depending on the cameras to determine if Cybertruck is approaching an obstruction can result in damage to the vehicle and/or objects and can potentially cause serious injury. Always inspect the area with your own eyes. Use the camera for guidance purposes only. It is not intended to replace your own direct visual checks and is not a substitute for careful driving.

The cabin camera can determine driver inattentiveness and enhances active safety features (such as Forward Collision Warning). You can also view the feed from this camera in the Tesla mobile app when Sentry Mode Live Camera is enabled (see Sentry Mode on page 151).

## Data Sharing

By default, images and video from the camera do not leave the vehicle itself and are not transmitted to anyone, including Tesla, unless you enable data sharing. If you enable data sharing and a safety critical event occurs (such as a collision), Cybertruck shares short cabin camera video clips with Tesla to help us develop future safety enhancements and continuously improve the intelligence of features that rely on the cabin camera. Data may also be shared if diagnostics are required on cabin camera functionality. Cabin camera does not perform facial recognition or any other method of identity verification. To protect your privacy, cabin camera data is not associated with your vehicle identification number.

To adjust your data sharing preferences touch Controls > Software > Data Sharing > Allow Cabin Camera Analytics. You can change your data sharing settings at any time.

## Cleaning a Camera

To ensure a clear picture, the camera lens must be clean and free of obstructions, condensation, or damage.

Condensation can form inside the camera enclosures, especially if you park outside in cold or wet conditions. The touchscreen may display an alert stating that a camera is blocked and that some (or all) Autopilot features may be temporarily restricted until the camera vision is clear. To proactively dry the condensation, precondition the cabin by setting it to a warm temperature, turning the windshield defroster on, and directing the front air vents toward the door pillars (see Mobile App on page 64).

## Cabin Camera

Your Cybertruck is equipped with a cabin camera located above the rear view mirror.

[Image of the cabin camera inside a Cybertruck]

Remove any build-up of dirt or debris by spraying water onto the camera lens and carefully drying it with a microfiber cloth. Clean the camera lens at least weekly during wet weather (snow, rain, sleet) and every month during dry weather.

The front-facing camera is equipped with a sprayer nozzle. To clean the front-facing camera, touch the app launcher, select the Camera app, and press the spray icon.

⚠️ CAUTION: Do not use chemical-based or abrasive cleaners. Doing so can damage the surface of the lens.

# Cameras

## Drive to Calibrate Cameras

Before some Autopilot features can be used for the first time or after some types of service repairs, cameras must complete a self-calibration process. When the cameras are calibrating, the touchscreen displays a progress indicator. When calibration is complete, Autopilot features are available for use.

Calibration typically completes after driving 20-25 miles (32-40 km), but the distance varies depending on the conditions. Calibration completes more quickly when driving on a straight road that has multiple lanes and highly visible lane markings in both the driving lane and adjacent lanes (at least two lanes over on each side of the vehicle). For best results, drive in the middle lane of a multi-lane highway (ideally with at least five lanes) that has clear lane markings and minimal traffic.

Schedule a service appointment only if your Cybertruck has not completed the calibration process after driving approximately 100 miles (160 km) in the described conditions.

If a camera has shifted from its previously calibrated position (for example, the camera or windshield was replaced), clear the calibration by touching Controls > Service > Camera Calibration > Clear Calibration. When the calibration is cleared, Cybertruck repeats the calibration process.

NOTE: Cybertruck must repeat the calibration process if the cameras are serviced by Tesla, and in some cases after a software update.

NOTE: If you attempt to use a feature that is not available until the calibration process is complete, the feature is not available and the touchscreen displays a message.

# Keys

## Types of Keys

NOTE: In the event you lose both key cards, schedule a service appointment through the mobile app to replace and pair them.

Cybertruck supports the following types of keys:

- Phone key - You can set up your personal phone as a "phone key" that communicates with Cybertruck using Bluetooth (BLE). A phone key supports automatic locking and unlocking.
- Key card - Tesla provides key cards that communicate with Cybertruck using short range radio-frequency identification (RFID) signals. Unlike the phone key, the key card does not support automatic locking and unlocking and must be touched against a card reader. In situations where your phone key has a dead battery, or is lost or stolen, use your key card to unlock, drive, and lock Cybertruck.

Cybertruck supports a total of 19 keys, which can include phone keys and key cards.

To view a list of keys that can currently access Cybertruck, or to remove a phone key, touch Controls > Locks (see Managing Keys on page 31).

Cybertruck can connect to three phone keys simultaneously. Therefore, if more than three phone keys are detected and you want to authenticate or pair a different phone, move the other connected phone key(s) out of range or turn off its Bluetooth setting.

### Key Card

Tesla provides you with two Cybertruck key cards, designed to fit in your wallet.

To use a key card to unlock or lock Cybertruck from outside, position the card as shown and tap it against the card reader located approximately one third the way up of the driver's side door pillar. When Cybertruck detects the key card, the exterior lights flash, the mirrors unfold or fold (if Fold Mirrors is on), the horn sounds (if Lock Confirmation Sound is on), and the doors unlock or lock. You may need to hold the key card against the transmitter for a few seconds.

> CAUTION: Remember to bring a key (and a backup key) with you when you drive. Although you can drive Cybertruck away from a detected key, you will be unable to power it back on after it powers off.

## Phone Key

> CAUTION: Do not leave your paired phone in your vehicle (for example, if you are hiking or at the beach). If you must leave your phone in the vehicle, disable Bluetooth and/or turn the phone off and ensure that you keep a key card with you.

Using your phone as a key is a convenient way to access your Cybertruck. As you approach your vehicle, the smartphone's Bluetooth signal is detected and the doors unlock when you press a door open button. Likewise, when you exit and walk away with the phone key, doors automatically lock (provided the Walk-Away Door Lock feature is turned on; see Walk-Away Door Lock on page 34).

Before you can use a phone to access Cybertruck, follow these steps to authenticate it (see XREF)

Once a phone has been authenticated, it no longer requires an internet connection to be used as a phone key for Cybertruck. However, to use the phone hands-free, access your phone's contacts, play media from it, etc., you must also pair it and connect it as a Bluetooth device (see Bluetooth on page 67).

NOTE: Some Android smartphones with NFC capability can be used to lock/unlock your vehicle, just like using a key card. Ensure the Tesla mobile app is correctly paired to your vehicle and enable the NFC function on your phone. Once enabled, simply hold the phone to the driver's side door pillar to lock or unlock the door. Refer to your smartphone's instructions for specific information on how to do this.

Once inside, power up Cybertruck by pressing the brake pedal within two minutes of scanning the key card (see Starting and Powering Off on page 72).

# Windows

## Opening and Closing

CAUTION: The windows automatically lower slightly when you open or close a door. This is normal and avoids damage to the window when the door opens. If you manually raise a window when the door is open, ensure it is slightly lowered before closing the door.

WARNING: Before closing a window, it is the driver's responsibility to ensure that all occupants, especially children, do not have any body parts extended through the window's opening. Failure to do so can cause serious injury.

WARNING: Never leave children unattended in Cybertruck.

Press down on a switch to lower the associated window. Window switches operate at two levels:

- To lower a window fully, press the switch all the way down and immediately release.
- To lower a window partially, press the switch gently and release when the window is where you want it.

[Image showing window switches and arrows indicating downward movement of windows]

Similarly, pull a switch to raise the associated window:

- To raise a window fully, pull the switch all the way up and immediately release.
- To raise a window partially, pull the switch gently and release when the window is where you want it.

NOTE: If a window is fully lowered and you open the associated door, the window rises slightly. Likewise, if you fully lower a window while the door is already open, it stops slightly above the edge of the door. To fully lower a window while the door is open, press the switch again.

If a window is left open unintentionally, Cybertruck can send a notification to the mobile app (touch Controls > Locks > Car Left Open Notification, then choose Doors & Windows). However, it is your responsibility to ensure windows are closed after leaving the vehicle; do not rely on notifications to inform you.

Enable Close Windows on Lock by touching Controls > Locks > Close Windows on Lock to automatically close the windows whenever the vehicle locks.

WARNING: To ensure safety, it is recommended that you lock the rear window switches whenever children are seated in the rear seats.

## Calibrating Windows

In the unlikely event that a window behaves unexpectedly (fails to open or close properly, goes down more than normal when the door opens, etc.), you can calibrate it to potentially fix the issue.

To calibrate a window:

1. Close the door with the affected window.
2. Sit in the driver's seat and close the driver door.
3. Using the window's switch on the driver's door, fully raise the affected window until it stops.
4. Using the window's switch on the driver's door, fully lower the affected window until it stops.
5. Repeat step 3 and fully raise the affected window until it stops.

If this does not resolve the issue after performing a few times, use your mobile app to schedule a Service appointment.

## UV Index Rating

The windshield, windows, and glass roof in Cybertruck are excellent at protecting you from UV (ultraviolet) rays. The glass components score less than two on the UV Index scale. Review your region's UV Index specifications for more information.

# Front and Rear Seats

## Correct Driving Position

The seat, head support, seat belt and airbags work together to maximize your safety. Using these correctly ensures greater protection.

Position the seat so you can wear the seat belt correctly, while being as far away from the front airbag as possible:

1. Sit upright with both feet on the floor and the seat back in an upright position.
2. Make sure you can easily reach the pedals and that your arms are slightly bent when holding the steering wheel. Your chest should be at least 10 inches (25 cm) from the center of the airbag cover.
3. Place the shoulder section of the seat belt mid-way between your neck and your shoulder. Fit the lap section of the belt tightly across your hips, not across your stomach.

## Adjusting Front Seats

NOTE: Only front seats in Cybertruck can be adjusted. The rear bench seat is stationary.

1. Move seat forward/backward and adjust the seat's height and tilt angle up/down.
2. Adjust backrest.
3. Adjust lumbar support.

| Seat Adjustment Controls |

# Front and Rear Seats

## Head Supports

The front seats and the rear outboard seats are equipped with integrated head supports that you cannot adjust.

The rear center seat is equipped with an adjustable head support that you can raise and lower:

- When the seat is occupied by a passenger that is not in a child safety seat, align the center of the corresponding head support with the center of the occupant's head, and ensure the head support is locked into position.
- When the seat is occupied by a child safety seat equipped with an upper tether strap, leave the head support in the raised position after routing the upper tether straps under it.

To raise the head support, pull it upward to the desired position. To lower it, press and hold the button on the base of the post on the right side of the head support while pushing the head support downward.

To re-install the rear center head support:

1. With the front of the head support facing forward, align both posts into the corresponding holes on the seat back.
2. While holding the button on the base of the post, press downward on the head support until it clicks into place.
3. Pull upward on the head support to ensure that it is secure.

> WARNING: Ensure that the head support is correctly installed before seating an occupant. Failure to do so increases the risk of injury or death if a collision occurs.

## Seat Heaters

All seats (except the rear center seat) are equipped with seat heaters that operate at three levels from 3 (highest) to 1 (lowest). For details on how to operate the seat heaters, see Climate Controls on page 154.

> WARNING: To minimize the risk of severe injury or death in the event of a collision, ensure that the rear center head support is positioned correctly before driving.

> WARNING: To avoid burns resulting from prolonged use, individuals who have peripheral neuropathy, or whose capacity to feel pain is limited because of diabetes, age, neurological injury, or some other condition, should exercise caution when using the climate control system and seat heaters.

## Removing/Installing the Rear Center Head Support

To remove the rear center head support:

1. Fully raise the head support by pulling it upward.
2. Press and hold the button located on the base at the right side of the head support.
3. Insert a short, flat object (such as a small flat-head screwdriver) into the opening in the base of the opposite post and pull the head support upward.

## Seat Covers

> WARNING: Do not use seat covers on a seat equipped with a seat-mounted airbag (see Location of Airbags on page 49). Doing so could restrict deployment of the seat-mounted side airbags if a collision occurs. Also, if the vehicle is equipped with an occupant detection system that is used to determine the status of the passenger front airbag, seat covers may interfere with this system.
---
# Seat Belts

## Wearing Seat Belts

Using seat belts and child safety seats is the most effective way to protect occupants if a collision occurs. Therefore, wearing a seat belt is required by law in most jurisdictions.

All seats are equipped with three-point inertia reel seat belts. Inertia reel belts are automatically tensioned to allow occupants to move comfortably during normal driving conditions.

## Seat Belt Reminders

The seat belt reminder on the touchscreen alerts you if a seat belt for an occupied driver or passenger seat is unbuckled. If all occupants are buckled up and the reminder stays on, re-buckle seat belts to ensure they are correctly latched. Also remove any heavy objects (such as a briefcase) from an unoccupied seat. If the reminder light continues to stay on, schedule a service appointment.

You can temporarily disable a seat belt reminder associated with a rear seating position. This is useful when you are carrying an object in a rear seat that triggers the seat belt reminder alert. To disable the reminder, touch the associated seat on the seat belt reminder popup message that displays on the touchscreen when a seat belt reminder is active. When a reminder is disabled, the seat belt reminder icon is replaced by a seat icon, for the current drive only. Touch the seat again to re-enable the reminder.

⚠️ WARNING: Seat belts must be worn by passengers in all seating positions. Do not disable a seat belt reminder when the seating position is occupied by a passenger.

## To Fasten a Belt

1. Ensure correct positioning of the seat (see Correct Driving Position on page 37).

2. Draw the belt out smoothly, ensuring the belt lays flat across the pelvis, chest and mid-point of your collar bone, between the neck and shoulder. Ensure the belt is routed correctly and is not twisted. Never sit on the seat belt or any seat belt component.

   ⚠️ WARNING: A twisted or incorrectly routed seat belt can cause damage and interfere with the functionality of the seat belt system.

3. Insert the latch plate into the buckle and press together until you hear a click indicating it is locked in place.

4. Pull the belt to check that it is securely fastened.

5. Pull the diagonal part of the belt toward the reel to remove excess slack.

## To Adjust the Shoulder Anchor Height

Cybertruck is equipped with an adjustable shoulder anchor for each front seat to ensure that the seat belt is positioned correctly. The seat belt should lay flat across the mid-point of your collar bone while in the correct driving position (see Correct Driving Position on page 37). Adjust the height of the shoulder anchor if the seat belt is not positioned correctly:

1. To raise the shoulder anchor, slide it upwards.

2. To lower the shoulder anchor, press and hold the arrow above the shoulder anchor while sliding the anchor downward. The arrow has a softer area underneath that engages a release button, allowing you to lower the anchor. Release the button when the shoulder anchor is in the desired position.

3. Without pressing the button, pull firmly downward on the seat belt to check that it is locked into position.

⚠️ WARNING: Ensure that the seat belt is positioned correctly and that the shoulder anchor is locked into position before driving. Riding in a moving vehicle with the seat belt positioned incorrectly or with the shoulder anchor not locked into position can reduce the effectiveness of the seat belt in a collision.

# Seat Belts

## To Release a Belt

Hold the belt near the buckle to prevent the belt from retracting too quickly, then press the button on the buckle. The belt retracts automatically. Ensure there is no obstruction that prevents the belt from fully retracting. The belt should not hang loose. If a seat belt does not fully retract, schedule a service appointment.

## Automatic Locking Retractor

All passenger seat belts include an automatic locking retractor (ALR) that you use to lock the seat belt in place. These self-locking retractors are typically used to securely hold a seat belt retained child safety seat (see Installing Seat Belt Retained Child Seats on page 44). To engage the locking retractor:

1. Fully extract the seat belt webbing (beyond the length needed for a typical adult occupant).
2. Fasten the seat belt as you normally would (see To Fasten a Belt on page 39).
3. Allow the belt to retract. You will hear a clicking sound. The ALR mechanism operates as a ratchet, winding in slack and preventing the seat belt from extending.

The automatic locking retractor disengages by unbuckling and fully retracting the seat belt. The belt can then be worn as a normal belt, sliding freely in and out and locking tight only in an emergency.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not use the automatic locking retractor (ALR) feature for booster seats in which a large child is restrained by the vehicle's seat belts directly, and therefore not using a child safety seat's integrated restraints.

⚠️ WARNING: If the seat belt is uncomfortable, adjust the seating position instead of wearing the seat belt incorrectly.

⚠️ WARNING: Never place anything between you and the seat belt to cushion the impact in the event of a collision.

## Seat Belt Pre-tensioners

The front seat belts are equipped with pre-tensioners that work in conjunction with the airbags in a collision. The pre-tensioners automatically retract both the seat belt lower anchor and the upper shoulder webbing, reducing slack in both the lap and diagonal portions of the belts, resulting in reduced forward movement of the occupant.

## Wearing Seat Belts When Pregnant

Do not put the lap or shoulder sections of the seat belt over the abdominal area. Wear the lap section of the belt as low as possible across the hips, not the waist. Position the shoulder portion of the belt between the breasts and to the side of the abdomen. Consult your doctor for specific guidance.

40                                                                Owner's Manual
---
# Seat Belts

The seat belts in all rear seating positions are equipped with shoulder pre-tensioners to retract the seat belt webbing to reduce forward movement of the occupant. If the pre-tensioners and airbags did not activate in an impact, this does not mean they malfunctioned. It usually means that the strength or type of force needed to activate them was not present.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not bend, sit on, or interfere with the pre-tensioner assembly. Doing so can cause damage that interferes with the proper functionality of the seat belt system.

⚠️ WARNING: Once the seat belt pre-tensioners have been activated, they must be replaced. After any collision, have the airbags, seat belt pre-tensioners and any associated components checked and, if necessary, replaced.

## Testing Seat Belts

To confirm that seat belts are operating correctly, perform these simple checks on each seat belt:

1. With the seat belt fastened, give the webbing nearest the buckle a quick and forceful pull. The buckle should remain securely locked.

2. With the seat belt fastened, give the webbing closest to the door a quick and forceful pull. The permanent seat belt attachment should remain securely locked. Never attempt to remove this attachment.

3. With the belt unfastened, unreel the webbing to its limit. Check that unreeling is free from snags, and visually check the webbing for wear. Allow the webbing to retract, checking that retraction is smooth and complete.

4. With the webbing half unreeled, hold the tongue plate and pull forward quickly. The mechanism should lock automatically and prevent further unreeling.

If a seat belt fails any of these tests, have the vehicle serviced before driving with the seat occupied.

For information about cleaning seat belts, see Seat Belts on page 193.

## Seat Belt Warnings

⚠️ WARNING: Seat belts should be worn by all occupants at all times, even if driving for a very short distance. Failure to do so increases the risk of injury or death if a collision occurs.

⚠️ WARNING: Secure small children in a suitable child safety seat as described in the Owner's Manual. Always follow the child safety seat manufacturer's instructions when installing.

⚠️ WARNING: Ensure that all seat belts are worn correctly. An improperly worn seat belt increases the risk of injury or death if a collision occurs.

⚠️ WARNING: Never sit on top of any seat belt component. Doing so can cause damage or interfere with the proper deployment of safety equipment.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not wear seat belts over hard, fragile or sharp items in clothing, such as pens, keys, eyeglasses, etc. The pressure from the seat belt on such items can cause injury.

⚠️ WARNING: Seat belts should not be worn with any part of the strap twisted.

⚠️ WARNING: Each seat belt assembly must be used by one occupant only. It is dangerous to put a seat belt around a child being carried on an occupant's lap.

⚠️ WARNING: Seat belts that have been worn in a collision must be inspected or replaced, if necessary, even if damage to the assembly is not obvious.

⚠️ WARNING: Seat belts that show signs of wear (such as fraying), or have been cut or damaged in any way, must be replaced.

⚠️ WARNING: Avoid contaminating a seat belt's components with any chemicals, liquids, grit, dirt or cleaning products. If a seat belt fails to retract or latch into the buckle, it must be replaced immediately.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not make modifications or additions that can prevent a seat belt mechanism from taking up slack, or that can prevent a seat belt from being adjusted to remove slack. A seat belt with slack greatly reduces occupant protection.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not make modifications that can interfere with the operation of a seat belt, or that can cause a seat belt to become inoperable.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not use third party comfort and convenience products that attach to the seat belts.

⚠️ WARNING: When seat belts are not in use, they should be fully retracted and not hanging loose. If a seat belt does not fully retract, schedule a service appointment.

⚠️ WARNING: The seat belt system has no user serviceable parts and may contain pyrotechnics. Do not disassemble, remove, or replace components.

# Child Safety Seats

## Passenger Front Airbag Must Be OFF

Your Cybertruck seat belts are designed for adults and larger children. You must restrain infants and small children in the rear seats only, and you must use a suitable child safety seat appropriate for the child's age, weight, and size.

WARNING: Never seat a child in the front passenger seat, even if using a child restraint system.

WARNING: Never seat a child on a seat with an ACTIVE AIRBAG in front of it. DEATH or SERIOUS INJURY to the child can occur.

Refer to the following label located on the sun visors.

NOTE: The image shown below is representative only and may not be identical to the label in your vehicle.

[A warning label image is shown with text in multiple languages and illustrations depicting proper child seat placement]

Cybertruck has an occupancy sensor in the front passenger seat that controls the status of the passenger front airbag (see Front Passenger Occupant Detection on page 51).

| PASSENGER AIRBAG OFF | Before driving with a child seat on the front passenger seat (if permitted in your market region), always double-check the status of the passenger front airbag to confirm that it is OFF. The Passenger Airbag OFF indicator displays on the touchscreen when the airbag is off. When off, the passenger airbag does not inflate when a collision occurs. |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

When the vehicle detects a passenger in the front seat, the passenger airbag is on. When on, the Passenger Airbag OFF icon should NOT be visible on the touchscreen. In this case, the airbag will inflate when a collision occurs.

WARNING: It is the driver's responsibility to confirm that the passenger front airbag is OFF when a child is seated in the front passenger seat. If the passenger front airbag fails to disable with a child seat in position, place the child and child restraint system in the rear seat and schedule a service appointment.

WARNING: Always ensure that all Cybertruck seats are locked in position before traveling. Failure to do so increases the risk of injury. Pay attention to all warnings displayed on the touchscreen.

WARNING: Do not associate the Easy Entry setting with the driver's profile when a child is seated in a rear seat. Doing so can cause the driver's seat to push against the child, especially when a child is seated in a forward-facing child seat or booster seat. Do not rely on Cybertruck to recognize or accommodate a child seated in the rear seats while using this setting (see Driver Profiles on page 96).

42                                                                                                                                     Owner's Manual

*Many child safety seats currently available allow children to ride rear-facing using the child safety seat's integrated 5-point harness for a longer period of time BASED UPON SPECIFIC HEIGHT AND WEIGHT LIMITS. Keep your child in a rear facing seat for as long as possible. CHECK THE CHILD SAFETY SEAT MANUFACTURER'S INSTRUCTIONS AND CAREFULLY FOLLOW ALL INSTRUCTIONS.

**LATCH ("Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children") and ISOFIX are international standards for attachment points for child safety seats in passenger cars that enable compliant child safety seats to be quickly and safely secured. The system has other regional names including LUAS ("Lower Universal Anchorage System") or Canfix in Canada. It has also been called the "Universal Child Safety Seat System" or UCSSS.

***Subject to instructions provided by the child safety seat manufacturer.

****Keep your child in a forward facing child safety seat with a harness and tether until the child reaches the child safety seat's maximum allowable height or weight as specified by the manufacturer of the child safety seat.

*****In the center seating position, the vehicle's head support can be adjusted if the booster seat is not equipped with an integrated head support.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not use LATCH anchors with child safety seats or booster seats that have an integral safety belt where the combined weight of the child plus the child safety seat exceeds 65 lbs (29 kg).

⚠️ WARNING: Laws that govern how and where children should be carried when traveling in a vehicle are subject to change. It is the driver's responsibility to keep up to date on, and comply with, all current regulations in the region(s) where Cybertruck is driven.

# Child Safety Seats

## Seating Larger Children

If a child is too large to fit into a child safety seat, but too small to safely fit into the standard seat belts, use a booster seat appropriate for the child's age and size. Carefully follow the manufacturer's instructions to secure the booster seat.

Avoid dressing the child in bulky clothing and do not place any objects between the child and the restraint system.

Adjust harnesses for every child, every trip.

To securely hold child safety seats, all passenger seating positions are equipped with an automatic locking retractor (ALR) feature that, by fully extracting the seat belt (beyond the length needed for a typical adult occupant), locks the belt into place until the seat belt is unbuckled and the webbing is fully retracted. The ALR mechanism operates as a ratchet, winding in slack and preventing the seat belt from extending any further until it has been completely rewound. When installing a child safety seat with integrated restraints, engage the belt's automatic locking retractor by pulling the seat belt webbing until it is fully extended. The ALR system engages only when the seat belt is at its maximum extension point.

The automatic locking retractor (ALR) feature is not used for booster seats in which a large child is restrained by the vehicle's seat belts directly, and therefore not using a child safety seat's integrated restraints.

NOTE: An automatic locking retractor disengages only when the seat belt is unbuckled and fully retracted. The belt can then be worn as a normal belt, sliding freely in and out and locking tight only in an emergency. Once disengaged, the belt must be fully extended to re-engage the locking mechanism whenever you install a child safety seat.

⚠️ WARNING: Larger children in booster seats should wear the seat belt like an adult. Do not fully extend the seat belt webbing to engage the automatic locking retracting (ALR).

## Installing Child Safety Seats

There are two general methods used to install child safety seats:

- Seat belt retained - these seats are secured using the vehicle's seat belts. All passenger seating positions in Cybertruck support the use of seat belt retained child safety seats.
- LATCH retained - these seats attach to anchor bars built into the rear seats. All rear seating positions in Cybertruck support the use of LATCH retained child safety seats.

Check the child safety seat manufacturer's instructions and the table in this manual to determine which installation method to use. Some child safety seats can be installed using either method. Always follow the child safety seat manufacturer's instructions.

Always follow the detailed instructions provided by the child safety seat manufacturer. General guidelines are provided below.

1. Place the child safety seat in Cybertruck and fully extend the seat belt (doing so engages the automatic locking retractor (see Automatic Locking Retractor on page 40).
2. Route the webbing and buckle the seat belt in accordance with the child safety seat manufacturer's instructions.

## Installing Seat Belt Retained Child Seats

First, make sure that the child safety seat is appropriate for the weight, height, and age of the child.

3. Allow the seat belt webbing to retract, and remove all slack while firmly pushing the child safety seat into the seat.

4. Once all slack has been removed, forcefully pull the seat belt webbing to confirm that the automatic locking retractor is engaged.

   NOTE: The automatic locking retractor disengages only after unbuckling and fully retracting the seat belt webbing. Once disengaged, the belt must be fully extended to re-engage the locking mechanism.

5. Attach the child safety seat's upper tether strap(s) (if equipped), as required by the manufacturer of the child safety seat (see Attaching Upper Tether Straps on page 46).

Carefully read and follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer of the child restraint system. The instructions describe how to slide the child restraint system onto the seat's anchor bars until you hear it "click" into place. You may need to push the child restraint system firmly against the seat back to ensure it fits snugly.

## Installing LATCH (ISOFIX) Child Seats

Lower LATCH anchors are provided in all rear seating positions. The anchors are located between the seat's back rest and cushion. The exact location of each anchor is identified by a child safety seat identification label. The label is located on the seat back, directly above its associated anchor.

[Image of a child safety seat being installed using LATCH system]

Adjust until the child restraint system is fitted firmly against the seat back. Ensure the child restraint system fits snugly.

# Child Safety Seats

Before seating a child, ensure that the child restraint system is securely installed. Grasp the front of the child restraint system with one hand on each side, and attempt to:

- Twist the child restraint system from side to side.
- Pull the child restraint system away from the seat.

If the child restraint system moves away from the seat, both latches are not fully engaged onto the seat's anchor bars. You must reinstall it and try again. It is critical that both latches on the child restraint system are fully engaged.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not use LATCH anchors with child seats or booster seats that have an integrated safety belt where the combined weight of the child plus the child restraint system exceeds 65 lbs (29 kg).

## Attaching Upper Tether Straps

If the child safety seat is equipped with an upper tether strap, attach its hook(s) to the anchor point located behind the associated rear seat. To access the center anchor point, flip the cover upward. To access an outboard anchor point, slide the cover to one side.

⚠️ WARNING: Tighten upper tether straps according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer of the child safety seat.

For the outboard seats, position dual-strap tethers on each side of the head support:

| Outboard Seats Dual-Strap Tether Positioning |
|----------------------------------------------|

# Child Safety Seats

## Testing a Child Safety Seat

Before seating a child, always make sure the child safety seat is not loose:

1. Hold the child safety seat by the belt path and try to slide the safety seat from side to side and front to back.
2. If the seat moves more than one inch (2.5 cm), it is too loose. Tighten the belt or reconnect the LATCH retained child safety seat.
3. If you are unable to reduce slack, try a different seat location or try another child safety seat.

## Child Safety Seat Warnings

For the center seat, route dual-strap tethers between the posts under the head support. Lift the head support (see Head Supports on page 38), then route the straps. Keep the head support in the raised position.

⚠️ WARNING: Extreme hazard! Do not seat a child on the front passenger seat even if you are using a child safety seat. This seat has an airbag in front of it. Although this airbag is disabled when Cybertruck detects a lightweight passenger, do not rely on technology to protect your child.

⚠️ WARNING: Child restraint systems are designed to be secured in vehicle seats by lap belts or the lap belt portion of a lap-shoulder belt. Children could be endangered in a crash if their child restraints are not properly secured in the vehicle.

⚠️ WARNING: According to collision statistics, a child is safer when properly restrained in a rear seat instead of the front seat.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not use a forward facing child safety seat until your child weighs over 20 lbs (9 kg) and can sit independently. Up to the age of two, a child's spine and neck are not sufficiently developed to avoid injury in a frontal impact.

⚠️ WARNING: In the center seat, do not run dual-strap tethers on each side of the head support.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not allow a baby or infant to be held on an adult's lap. All children must be restrained in an appropriate child safety seat at all times.

For the center seat, route a single-strap tether between the posts under the head support. Lift the head support (see Head Supports on page 38), then route the strap. Keep the head support in the raised position.

⚠️ WARNING: To ensure children are safely seated, follow all instructions provided in this document and by the manufacturer of the child safety seat.

⚠️ WARNING: Children should ride in a rear facing child safety seat using the seat's integrated 5-point harness for as long as possible.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not use seat belt extenders on a seat belt that is being used to install a child safety seat or booster seat.

⚠️ WARNING: When seating larger children, make sure the child's head is supported and the child's seat belt is properly adjusted and fastened. The shoulder portion of the belt must be away from the face and neck, and the lap portion must not be over the stomach.

⚠️ WARNING: Never attach two child safety seats to one anchor point. In a collision, one anchor point may be incapable of securing both seats.

# Child Safety Seats

⚠️ WARNING: Child restraint anchors are designed to withstand only those loads imposed by correctly fitted child restraints. Under no circumstances are they to be used for adult seat belts, harnesses, or for attaching other items or equipment to the vehicle.

⚠️ WARNING: Always check harnesses and tether straps for damage and wear.

⚠️ WARNING: Never leave a child unattended, even if the child is secured in a child safety seat.

⚠️ WARNING: Never use a child safety seat that has been involved in a collision. Have the seat inspected or replaced as described in the child safety seat manufacturer's instructions.

# Airbags

## Location of Airbags

Airbags are located in the approximate areas shown below. Airbag warning information is printed on the sun visors.

Cybertruck is equipped with an airbag and lap/shoulder belt (also called seat belt assembly) at both designated front seating positions. The airbag is a supplemental restraint at those seating positions. All occupants, including the driver, should always wear their seat belts whether or not an airbag is also provided at their seating position to minimize the risk of severe injury or death in the event of a crash.

[A diagram of the Cybertruck showing the locations of various airbags]

# Airbags

## How Airbags Work

Airbags inflate when sensors detect an impact that exceeds deployment thresholds. These thresholds are designed to predict the severity of a crash in time for the airbags to help protect the vehicle's occupants. Airbags inflate instantly with considerable force accompanied by a loud noise. The inflated bag, together with the seat belts, limits movement of occupants to reduce the risk of injury.

The Passenger Airbag Off indicator displays on the touchscreen when the passenger front airbag is OFF. When the passenger front airbag is OFF, it does not inflate when a collision occurs. When driving with a child seat on the front passenger seat (if permitted in your market region), always double-check the status of the passenger front airbag to confirm that it is OFF.

Front airbags are not ordinarily designed to inflate in rear collisions, rollovers, side collisions and when braking heavily or driving over bumps and potholes. Likewise, front airbags may not inflate in all frontal collisions, such as minor front collisions, underride collisions, or minor impacts with narrow objects (such as posts or poles). Significant superficial damage can occur to the vehicle without the airbags inflating and, conversely, a relatively small amount of structural damage can cause airbags to inflate. Therefore, the external appearance of the vehicle after a collision does not represent whether or not the front airbags should have inflated.

To protect an adult occupying the front passenger seat, ensure the passenger front airbag is ON – when ON, a Passenger Airbag OFF icon should not be visible on the touchscreen. When the passenger airbag is ON, it may inflate when a collision occurs.

The airbag indicator displays on the touchscreen for a few seconds at the start of every drive while checking the following functionality, as applicable:

- Airbags
- Seat belts with pre-tensioners and load limiters
- Impact sensors
- Occupant sensors
- Seat belt sensors
- Passive safety component wiring harnesses
- Onboard restraint controlled components (ex: accelerometer and other passive safety components)

After this check, the airbag indicator turns off. If the airbag system detects a fault in any of the previously mentioned components, the airbag warning indicator stays on. In this case contact Tesla service immediately. Do not drive the vehicle until the airbag system is inspected by Tesla.

⚠️ WARNING: Before modifying your vehicle to accommodate a person with disabilities in a way that may affect the airbag system, schedule a service appointment.

## Types of Airbags

Cybertruck has the following types of airbags:

- Front airbags: The front airbags are designed to reduce injuries if larger children or adults are riding in the front seats. Follow all warnings and instructions related to seating a child on the front passenger seat (if permitted in your market region).

- Knee airbags: Knee airbags and the front airbags work together. The knee airbags limit the forward motion of the front seat occupants by restricting leg movement, thereby positioning the occupants so that the front airbags work more effectively.

- Seat-mounted airbags: A seat-mounted side airbag in the front seats helps protect the pelvis and the thorax region of the torso. The seat-mounted airbag on the inside portion of the driver's seat helps protect the head and torso. Seat-mounted airbags on both the impacted and non-impacted side of the vehicle inflate in the event of a severe side impact or a severe offset frontal impact.

- Curtain airbags: Curtain airbags help protect the head. Curtain airbags on both the impacted and non-impacted side of the vehicle inflate only if a severe side impact occurs, or if the vehicle rolls over.

## Airbag Status Indicator

The status of the passenger front airbag displays on the touchscreen:
---
# Airbags

## Front Passenger Occupant Detection

Cybertruck has an occupancy sensor in the front passenger seat that controls the status of the front airbag.

NOTE: The occupancy classification system (OCS) meets the regulatory requirement of FMVSS 208 and automatically detects when inflating the passenger front airbag would be unnecessary or potentially harmful.

WARNING: Seating an infant in a rear facing child restraint system on a seat equipped with an operational airbag can cause serious injury or death.

| Object Classification | OCS Passenger Airbag Status* | Indicator status | Notes |
|------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Empty | OFF | PASSENGER AIRBAG OFF | |
| Object | OFF or ON | PASSENGER AIRBAG OFF or PASSENGER AIRBAG ON | Depends on material/contents |
| Rear-facing child restraint system designed for children up to One Year Old | OFF | PASSENGER AIRBAG OFF | Less than 22 lbs (10 kg) |
| Forward facing child restraint system | OFF | PASSENGER AIRBAG OFF | Less than 35 lbs (16 kg) |
| Child in a booster seat | OFF | PASSENGER AIRBAG OFF | Less than 51 lbs (23 kg) |
| Large child | OFF or ON | PASSENGER AIRBAG OFF or PASSENGER AIRBAG ON | 51 lbs (23 kg) or more and less than 103 lbs (47 kg) |
| 5th percentile female or larger (by weight) | ON | PASSENGER AIRBAG ON | Over approximately 103 lbs (47 kg) |

*If the passenger airbag status indicator does not match the situation, do not use the seat. The passenger must ride in a different seat. Schedule a service appointment.

NOTE: It takes approximately six seconds after you power on Cybertruck for the occupant classification system (OCS) to report accurate status of the front passenger airbag. As a result, when you first power on Cybertruck, even in situations when it should be OFF because the seat is occupied by a weight of 20 lbs (9 kg) or less, it will take the touchscreen approximately six seconds to display the status, PASSENGER AIRBAG OFF. If it fails to do so, schedule a service appointment and do not seat a child in the front passenger seating position.

To make sure the sensing system can correctly detect occupancy status, eliminate the following:

- Objects lodged under the seat.
- Heavy objects sitting on the seat (briefcase, large purse).
- Objects wedged between the seat back and seat cushion.
- Cargo interfering with the seat.
- Aftermarket items attached to, or sitting on or between, the seat and occupant including but not limited to covers, mats, blankets, etc.

These conditions can interfere with the occupancy sensor. If you have eliminated the above possibilities, and the airbag status is still incorrect, ask passengers to ride in the rear seats and schedule a service appointment to have the airbag system checked.

NOTE: The front passenger occupancy sensor affects the operation of the passenger front airbags only. The side airbags are not affected.

WARNING: If the front passenger airbag is not turning on or off as expected based on the weight thresholds previously described, schedule a service appointment immediately.

WARNING: If seating a child in the front passenger seat is legally permissible in your market region, it is the driver's responsibility to ensure that the passenger front airbag is OFF. Never seat a child in a rear facing safety seat in the front passenger seat with an active airbag. DEATH or SERIOUS INJURY to the child can occur. Per recommendations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all occupants age 12 and under must ride in the rear seats.

# Airbags

## Ensuring Accurate Occupant Detection

To help ensure an occupant in the front passenger seat can be accurately detected, the passenger must:

- Wear a seat belt.
- Sit upright on the center of the seat cushion, with shoulders resting against the seat back and legs extended comfortably in front with feet on the floor. See Examples of Correct and Incorrect Seating Positions on page 54.
- Remain positioned on the seat cushion and not lift their weight off the seat (for example, by pushing their feet against the floor or pressing on the center console or armrest to lift up).
- Never wear thick, wet, or bulky clothing (such as ski wear or padded clothing).

In addition to the items listed above, the following situations can interfere with the accuracy of the occupant classification system:

- Incorrectly placing a child restraint system so that the entire lower section is not positioned against the seat cushion.
- Objects lodged under the seat or wedged between the seat back and cushion.
- Heavy objects sitting on the seat (briefcase, large purse).
- Cargo interfering with the seat.

These conditions can interfere with the occupancy sensor. If you have eliminated the above possibilities, and the airbag status is still incorrect, instruct passengers to ride in the rear seats and schedule a service appointment to have the airbag system checked.

NOTE: Tesla follows NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) recommendations that all occupants age 12 and under be seated in a rear seat.

NOTE: The front passenger occupancy sensor affects the operation of the passenger front and side airbags.

⚠️ WARNING: Failure to follow the above instructions can adversely affect the Occupant Classification System (OCS) which can cause serious injury or death.

⚠️ WARNING: If the front passenger airbag is not turning on or off as expected, do not seat a passenger in the front passenger seat. Schedule a service appointment.

⚠️ WARNING: To ensure accuracy of the occupant detection system, do not make any modifications to the front passenger seat.

# Airbags

## Inflation Effects

WARNING: When airbags inflate, a fine powder is released. This powder can irritate the skin and should be thoroughly flushed from the eyes and from any cuts or abrasions.

After inflation, the airbags deflate to provide a gradual cushioning effect for the occupants and to ensure the driver's forward vision is not obscured.

If airbags have inflated, or if your vehicle has been in a collision, always have the airbags, seat belt pre-tensioners and any associated components checked and, if necessary, replaced.

In a collision, in addition to the airbags inflating:

- Doors unlock.
- Hazard warning lights turn on.
- Interior lights turn on.
- High voltage is disabled (you must contact Roadside Assistance to restore high voltage power).
- Seat belt pre-tensioners retract the seat belt anchor and seat belt webbing.

NOTE: Depending on the nature of the impact and the forces involved, doors may not unlock in a collision and/or damage may prevent them from opening. In such cases, the door may need to be opened using the interior manual release, or other means of extrication (for example, exiting through another door, breaking the window, etc.).

WARNING: Children should not be seated on the front passenger seat unless permitted by regulations in your market region. Follow all regulations in your region for the appropriate way to seat a child based on the child's weight, size, and age. The safest place to seat infants and young children is in a rear seating position. Seating an infant or child in a rear-facing child restraint system on a seat equipped with an operational airbag can cause serious injury or death.

WARNING: To ensure correct inflation of the side airbags, maintain an unobstructed gap between an occupant's torso and the side of Cybertruck.

WARNING: Passengers shouldn't lean their heads against doors. Doing so can cause injury if a curtain airbag inflates.

WARNING: Do not allow passengers to obstruct the operation of an airbag by placing feet, knees or any other part of the body on or near an airbag.

WARNING: Do not attach or place objects on or near the front airbags, the side of the front seats, the headliner at the side of the vehicle, or any other airbag cover that could interfere with inflation of an airbag. These include but are not limited to: steering wheel covers, decals, seat cushions or pillows, etc. Objects can cause serious injury if the vehicle is in a collision severe enough to cause the airbag to inflate.

WARNING: Do not use seat covers on the front seats. Doing so could restrict deployment of the seat-mounted airbags if a collision occurs.

WARNING: Following inflation, some airbag components are hot. Do not touch until they have cooled.

## Airbag Warnings

WARNING: Do not place objects over or near airbags because any such objects could cause harm if the vehicle is in a crash severe enough to cause the airbag to inflate.

WARNING: All occupants, including the driver, should always wear their seat belts, whether or not an airbag is also provided at their seating position, to minimize the risk of severe injury or death in the event of a collision.

WARNING: Front seat occupants should not place their arms over the airbag module, as an inflating airbag can cause fractures or other injuries.

WARNING: Airbags inflate with considerable speed and force, which can cause injury. To limit injuries, ensure that occupants are wearing seat belts and are correctly seated, with the seat positioned as far back as possible. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recommends a minimum distance of 10 inches (25 cm) between an occupant's chest and an airbag.

# Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi is available as a data connection method and is often faster than cellular data networks. Connecting to Wi-Fi is especially useful in areas with limited or no cellular connectivity. To ensure fast, reliable delivery of software and map updates, Tesla recommends leaving Cybertruck connected to a Wi-Fi network whenever possible (for example, when parked at home).

To connect to a Wi-Fi network:

1. Touch Controls > Wi-Fi. Cybertruck begins to scan and display detected Wi-Fi networks that are within range.

   NOTE: If a known Wi-Fi network does not appear in the list, move Cybertruck closer to the access point or consider using a range extender.

   NOTE: When connecting to a 5GHz network (if available), check which channels are supported in your region.

   | 5GHz Network Channels Supported |||||
   |:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
   | 36-48 | 52-64 | 100-140 | 149-165 |
   | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

2. Find and tap the the Wi-Fi network you want to use in Searching for Wi-Fi Networks or add it manually in Add Wi-Fi Networks, enter the password (if necessary), then touch Confirm. When successfully connected, the Wi-Fi network shows in Known Wi-Fi Networks along with a green check. Whenever the network is within range, Cybertruck connects to it automatically.

   NOTE: Cybertruck does not currently support connections to captive Wi-Fi networks (a captive Wi-Fi, commonly used by public hotspots, requires you to access a custom web portal and agree to terms of service prior to allowing you to log in).

NOTE: If more than one previously connected network is within range, Cybertruck connects to the one most recently used.

NOTE: At Tesla Service Centers, Cybertruck automatically connects to the Tesla Service Wi-Fi network.

## Troubleshooting Tips

If your vehicle's Wi-Fi connection is slow or it fails to connect, try these tips.

- On the touchscreen, check the number of Wi-Fi icon bars (signal strength). If the bars are low, consider adding a Wi-Fi access point closer to the vehicle to improve the signal.
- Restart the touchscreen (see Touchscreen on page 7).
- Remove the Wi-Fi connection and reconnect. Touch Controls > Wi-Fi, select your network and Forget Network then reconnect by touching your network in Known Networks.
- Try a different Wi-Fi network.

# Bluetooth

## Bluetooth® Compatibility

You can use various Bluetooth devices in Cybertruck provided it is paired and within operating range. For example, you can pair your Bluetooth-capable phone so you can use it hands-free. In addition to phones, you can pair other Bluetooth-enabled devices with Cybertruck. For example, you can pair an iPod Touch, iPad, Android tablet, etc. from which you can play music.

Before using your phone or other Bluetooth device with Cybertruck, you must pair it. Pairing sets up Cybertruck to communicate with supported Bluetooth-capable devices. You can pair up to ten Bluetooth phones. Unless you've specified a specific phone as a Priority Device, or if the phone specified as Priority Device is not within range, Cybertruck always connects to the last phone that was used (provided it is within range). To connect to a different phone, see Switching Between Paired Devices on page 68.

NOTE: Authenticating your phone to use as a key (see Keys on page 30) does not allow you to use the phone hands-free, play media from it, etc. You must also pair it as described below.

NOTE: On many phones, Bluetooth turns off if the phone's battery is low.

NOTE: Although Bluetooth typically supports wireless communication over distances of up to approximately 30 feet (nine meters), performance can vary based on the phone, or other device, you are using.

NOTE: Cybertruck can pair up to twenty Bluetooth devices at a time but only allows two devices to connect simultaneously (such as one phone and one controller or two controllers) to each front and rear touchscreen (if equipped).

CAUTION: Do not leave your paired phone in your vehicle (for example, if you are hiking or at the beach). If you must leave your phone in the vehicle, disable Bluetooth and/or turn the phone off.

## Pairing a Phone or Bluetooth Device

Pairing allows you to use your Bluetooth-capable phone hands-free to make and receive phone calls, access your contact list, recent calls, etc. It also allows you to play media files from your phone. Once a phone is paired, Cybertruck can connect to it whenever the phone is within range.

1. To pair a phone or a Bluetooth device, sit inside Cybertruck and ensure the touchscreen is on.

2. Unlock your phone and enable Bluetooth (typically in Settings on your phone).
   NOTE: On some phones, this may require you to go to Bluetooth Settings for the remainder of the procedure.

3. On the touchscreen, touch Controls > Bluetooth to automatically start Bluetooth scanning for new devices.

4. Wait for your phone to be listed and touch Connect.

5. Check that the number displayed on your phone matches the number on the touchscreen. Then, on your phone, confirm that you want to pair.

6. If prompted on your phone, specify whether you want to allow Cybertruck to access your personal information, such as calendar, contacts and media files (see Importing Contacts and Recent Calls on page 67). When paired, Cybertruck lists your phone under Controls > Bluetooth > Paired Devices.

To change the settings of a paired device, go to Controls > Bluetooth > Paired Devices and expand the dropdown next to the device's name.

If you are experiencing issues importing or connecting to Bluetooth, see Troubleshooting Bluetooth on page 68 for more information.

## Importing Contacts and Recent Calls

Once a phone is paired, go to Controls > Bluetooth > Paired Devices and expand the dropdown next to the device's name to specify whether you want to allow access to your phone's contacts, recent calls and text messages. If you allow access, you can use the phone app to make calls and send messages to people in your list of contacts and on your recent calls list (see Phone, Calendar, and Web Conferencing on page 69). Before contacts can be imported, you may need to either set your phone to allow syncing, or respond to a popup on your phone to confirm that you want to sync contacts. This varies depending on the type of phone you are using. For details, refer to the documentation provided with your phone.

If you are having trouble importing contacts or pairing with Bluetooth, see Troubleshooting Bluetooth on page 68 for more information.

## Disconnecting or Unpairing a Bluetooth Device

If you want to disconnect your phone or Bluetooth device, but keep it paired, touch Disconnect in your phone's Bluetooth settings dropdown on the touchscreen (Controls > Bluetooth > Paired Devices > Your phone). If you no longer want to use your device with Cybertruck, touch Forget Device and follow the instructions. Once you forget a device, you must pair it again if you want to use it with Cybertruck (see Pairing a Phone or Bluetooth Device on page 67).

NOTE: Your phone automatically disconnects when you leave Cybertruck.

NOTE: Unpairing the phone has no effect on using the phone as a key. To forget an authenticated phone, see Managing Keys on page 31.

# Bluetooth

## Switching Between Paired Devices

Cybertruck automatically connects to a phone that you designated as Priority Device. If you have not set a phone as a priority, Cybertruck connects to the last phone to which is was connected, provided it is within operating range and has Bluetooth turned on. If the last phone is not within range, it attempts to connect with the next phone that it has been paired with.

To connect to a different phone, touch Controls > Bluetooth > Paired Devices. Select the phone you want to connect to, then touch Connect. If the phone you want to connect to is not listed, you must pair the phone. See Pairing a Phone or Bluetooth Device on page 67.

When connected, the Bluetooth settings screen displays the Bluetooth symbol next to the phone's name to show that Cybertruck is connected to the phone.

## Troubleshooting Bluetooth

Your vehicle uses Bluetooth and BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) to seamlessly connect your smartphone to Cybertruck. Due to several potential factors, Bluetooth or BLE may sometimes disconnect or experience issues in the pairing process. Connecting to Bluetooth allows your vehicle to use phone functions such as audio, phone calls, calendars, text messages, etc.

BLE is used for passive functions like phone key.

NOTE: Do not unpair your vehicle to your phone or remove it as phone key without a working key card nearby.

Try the following to troubleshoot Bluetooth, starting with your smartphone.

### Smartphone Troubleshooting

Bluetooth may not connect due to settings and updates on your smartphone:

- Enable Bluetooth on your phone. If already enabled, disable and re-enable Bluetooth again.
- Ensure Airplane Mode is turned off.
- Charge your phone; if your phone battery is too low, it may not support Bluetooth functions.
- Pair your device properly. If already paired, try unpairing and re-pairing again.
- Update your phone to the latest software provided by the manufacturer.
- Check that your vehicle's sound system is selected as the audio output source.
- Ensure your phone's settings allow for Bluetooth (ex: data is turned on or you are connected to Wi-Fi).
- Turn your phone off and on again.
- Ensure location permissions set to "Always On" for the mobile app.

### Tesla Mobile App Troubleshooting

Check the Tesla mobile app:

- Confirm the Tesla mobile app is up to date on software.
- Verify you're logged into the Tesla mobile app while using your phone key.
- Ensure the Tesla app is running in the background.
- Double check that you have completely set up your profile in the mobile app and properly configured your settings.

### Vehicle Troubleshooting

Your vehicle's settings may affect its ability to pair with your smartphone:

- Charge Cybertruck: If the vehicle Battery is too low, you may lose Bluetooth function.
- Update vehicle software and make sure it is always up to date. Check for new software updates by navigating to Controls > Software.
- Restart the touchscreen. See #unique_229 on page .
- Reboot your vehicle.

If Bluetooth still does not work, unpair from your vehicle AND smartphone. Then try re-pairing both again.

For BLE phone key issues, when in the vehicle, navigate to Controls > Locks and remove your phone as "Phone as Key". Then set it back up again. But only do this while you are in the vehicle and have a reliable back up key available (such as a key card).

# Smart Garage

## myQ

If equipped, Cybertruck can intelligently
connect to your myQ® smart garage.

myQ is a smart garage control system that works seamlessly
with Cybertruck, and allows you to remotely monitor and
control your garage door from the vehicle's touchscreen or a
paired phone. This is convenient if you forget to close your
garage door, want to allow friends and family inside, or need
to open and close it remotely (such as when receiving a
package). By linking myQ with Cybertruck, the garage door
can detect your vehicle nearby and automatically open or
close to accommodate.

Follow these steps to set up myQ on your vehicle:

1. Your garage door must be myQ compatible. Navigate to
   Controls > Garage icon. Use the myQ Compatibility tool
   (https://www.myq.com/app/myq-compatibility) to
   determine this.

2. Ensure your garage is Wi-Fi compatible. myQ uses Wi-Fi
   to communicate with your smart phone and vehicle. Some
   garages will have a Wi-Fi or myQ symbol on the hub. Your
   garage must have a strong Wi-Fi signal to control and
   monitor your garage through your vehicle.

   NOTE: If your garage is not compatible, you may be able
   to purchase an external myQ hub to use this feature.

3. Download the myQ app from your smart phone's app
   store. Use the app to set up your account information and
   pair the garage to your phone. myQ requires a paid
   subscription, which you can purchase in the app.

4. Check that your vehicle is running the latest available
   software version and has Wi-Fi or LTE connectivity.

5. Navigate to Controls > Locks > myQ Connected Garage >
   Link Account and follow the instructions to pair the garage
   with Cybertruck. Once paired, monitoring and controlling
   the garage becomes available on the touchscreen, where
   you can further customize myQ.

# Starting and Powering Off

## Starting

When you open a door to enter Cybertruck, the touchscreen powers on and you can operate all controls. To shift Cybertruck, press the brake pedal and swipe up for Drive or down for Reverse on the touchscreen's drive mode strip (see Shifting on page 73).

If Auto Shift out of Park is enabled, Cybertruck automatically selects Drive or Reverse based on the detected surroundings. Pressing the brake pedal shifts the vehicle into the selected drive mode displayed on the touchscreen's drive mode strip (provided the driver's door is closed and the driver's seat belt is buckled), and pressing the accelerator moves the vehicle in that direction.

NOTE: To turn Auto Shift out of Park on or off, touch Controls > Dynamics > Auto Shift out of Park.

Before accelerating when Auto Shift out of Park is enabled, check the touchscreen to make sure that Cybertruck has shifted into the drive mode you want (Drive or Reverse). If the selection is not correct, or if Auto Shift out of Park is not enabled, swipe up for Drive or down for Reverse on the touchscreen's drive mode strip to choose a new drive mode. See Shifting on page 73.

NOTE: If PIN to Drive is enabled (see PIN to Drive on page 148), you must enter a valid PIN on the touchscreen before you can drive Cybertruck.

Everything you need to know when driving Cybertruck displays on the touchscreen.

### Drive Disabled - Requires Authentication

If Cybertruck does not detect a key when you press the brake (a phone key is not detected or two minutes have passed since you used the key card), the touchscreen displays a message telling you that driving requires authentication.

If you see this message, place the key card in either phone dock where the RFID transmitter can read it. The two-minute authentication period restarts and you can start Cybertruck by pressing the brake pedal.

[An image shows a close-up of what appears to be a phone dock or charging area in a vehicle. There's a rectangular object, possibly a key card or phone, placed in the dock with a glowing circular pattern around it, suggesting wireless charging or key detection.]

A number of factors can affect whether Cybertruck can detect a phone key (for example, the device's battery is low or dead and is no longer able to communicate using Bluetooth).

Always keep your phone key or a key card with you. After driving, your key is needed to restart Cybertruck. And when you leave the vehicle, you must bring your key with you to lock Cybertruck, either manually or automatically.

## Powering Off

When you finish driving and shift into Park, simply exit the vehicle. When you leave Cybertruck with your phone key, it powers off automatically, turning off the touchscreen.

Cybertruck also powers off automatically after being in Park for 30 minutes, even if you are sitting in the driver's seat.

Although usually not needed, you can power off Cybertruck while sitting in the driver's seat, provided the vehicle is not moving. Touch Controls > Safety > Power Off. Cybertruck automatically powers back on after a short period if you press the brake pedal or touch the touchscreen.

NOTE: Cybertruck automatically shifts into Park whenever it determines that you are exiting the vehicle (for example, the driver's seat belt is unbuckled and the vehicle is almost at a standstill). If you shift into Neutral, your vehicle shifts into Park when you open the door to exit. To keep your vehicle in Neutral, you will need to activate Transport Mode (see Instructions for Transporters on page 228).

## Power Cycling the Vehicle

You can power cycle Cybertruck if it demonstrates unusual behavior or displays a nondescript alert.

NOTE: If the touchscreen is unresponsive or demonstrates unusual behavior, reboot it before you power cycle the vehicle (see Restarting the Touchscreen on page 10).

1. Shift into Park.
2. On the touchscreen, touch Controls > Safety > Power Off.
3. Wait for at least two minutes without interacting with the vehicle. Do not open the doors, touch the brake pedal, touch the touchscreen, etc.
4. After two minutes, open the door to wake the vehicle.

50%                                11:52 am
```

The touchscreen always shows which gear Cybertruck is in, but the drive mode strip is hidden when driving at highway speeds. To show the drive mode strip at any time, swipe right from the left edge of the touchscreen.

To shift into Park when driving below 5 mph (8 km/h), touch the drive mode strip while pressing the brake pedal. In emergency situations when driving above 5 mph (8 km/h), press and hold the gear strip to slowly bring the vehicle to a stop.

NOTE: To shift from Drive into Reverse or vice versa, the driving speed must be less than 5 mph (8 km/h).

The touchscreen is the preferred method to manually shift. However, in the unlikely situation in which the touchscreen is unavailable and therefore can't be used, the drive mode selector on the overhead console automatically activates and must be used to shift (see Shift Using the Overhead Console on page 73).

If you try to shift when it is prohibited by the current driving speed, the touchscreen displays an alert, a chime sounds, and the drive mode does not change.

## Auto Shift from Park

Auto Shift from Park is a BETA feature and is disabled by default. When disabled, use the touchscreen or the overhead console to manually shift. To enable Auto Shift from Park, touch Controls > Dynamics > Auto Shift from Park.

When Auto Shift from Park is enabled, Cybertruck is designed to automatically select Drive or Reverse. The touchscreen displays the selected drive mode when the driver's door is closed and seat belt is buckled.

To override the selection, press the brake pedal and use the drive mode strip on touchscreen to shift into your desired drive mode (Drive, Reverse, Park; see Shift Using the Touchscreen on page 73).

Confirm the drive mode selection and follow the instructions on the touchscreen before you press the accelerator.

⚠️ WARNING: As always, be aware of your vehicle and surroundings before driving. Never rely on Cybertruck to automatically select a suitable drive mode without confirming the selection before you start to drive.

If Auto Shift from Park is unavailable, the touchscreen displays a message.

Cybertruck automatically selects a drive mode when:

- Auto Shift from Park is enabled.
- Cybertruck is in Park.
- The driver's seat belt is fastened.
- The brake pedal is pressed.
- All doors and trunks are closed.
- The drive mode selector on the overhead console is not activated (see Shift Using the Overhead Console on page 73).
- The cameras are free of obstructions (see Cameras on page 27) and Cybertruck has enough input to make a selection.

NOTE: Cybertruck does not automatically select drive modes in Valet Mode.

## Shift Using the Overhead Console

In addition to manually shifting on the touchscreen, you can shift by pressing P, R, N or D located on the overhead console. In most situations, these buttons are not available until you press one of the buttons to activate it. When active, the LEDs associated with each button illuminate and when you select P, R, N or D, the associated LED illuminates.

In situations where the touchscreen is unavailable (for example, experiencing a technical issue), or Cybertruck is in Valet or Transport Mode, the drive mode selector on the overhead console illuminates automatically and there is no need to touch it.

- **Bed Lights**: The lights running on the sides of the truck cargo bed can be set to Off, On, or Auto. When set to Auto, the bed lights turn on when Cybertruck is parked and the tonneau cover or tailgate is open. You can also toggle the tailgate button to turn the bed lights on or off for your convenience. See Cargo Bed on page 60 for more information.

⚠️ CAUTION: Ensure the headlights and tail lights are On during low visibility conditions (for example, when it is dark, foggy, snowy, or the road is wet, etc.). The tail lights are off while daytime running lights are on. Failure to do so can cause damage or serious injury.

## Headlights

The following indicator lights are visible on the touchscreen to show the status of the headlights. If none of these indicator lights are on, the headlights are off.

| Icon | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Low beam icon | Low beam headlights are on. |
| Headlights on icon | The headlights are on. Illuminates when headlights are on but the Auto High Beam setting is turned off or if the Auto High Beam setting is turned on but is temporarily unavailable. |
| High beams on icon | High beams are currently turned on, and Auto High Beam is ready to turn off the high beams if light is detected in front of Cybertruck. |
| High beams off icon | High beams are temporarily turned off because Auto High Beam is operating and light is detected in front of Cybertruck. When light is no longer detected, high beam headlights automatically turn back on. |

Use the headlights button on the left side of the steering wheel to control the headlights:

- Press and quickly release to flash headlights.

If a severe crash is detected by your vehicle, the hazard lights will automatically turn on and flash quickly to increase visibility. Pressing the hazard lights once will return the lights to its normal cadence. Pressing a second time turns all hazard lights off.

NOTE: Hazard warning flashers operate even without a key nearby.

## Headlights After Exit

When you stop driving and park Cybertruck in low lighting conditions, exterior lights temporarily remain illuminated. They automatically turn off after one minute or when you lock Cybertruck, whichever comes first.

To turn this feature on and off, touch Controls > Lights > Headlights After Exit. When Headlights After Exit is off, the headlights turn off immediately when you engage Park and open a door.

## Condensation in Headlights or Tail lights

Due to weather changes, humidity levels, or recent exposure to water (such as a car wash), condensation may occasionally accumulate in your vehicle's headlights or tail lights. This is normal— as the weather gets warmer and humidity decreases, condensation often disappears on its own. If you notice water buildup within the exterior lenses, or if the condensation affects the visibility of the exterior lights, use the mobile app to schedule a service appointment.

# Windshield Wiper and Washers

You can access wiper settings by touching the wiper button on the steering wheel or by accessing the app launcher and touching Wiper.

You can also drag the Wiper control to your My Apps area for easier access.

Press and quickly release the wiper button on the steering wheel to wipe the windshield. If the wiper is already operating at a wiper setting and is not set to Auto, pressing the wiper button cycles through speeds. Wiper speeds cycle as follows: I > II > III > IIII > III > II > I.

Press and hold the wiper button to spray washer fluid onto the windshield. After releasing the button, the wipers perform two additional wipes then, depending on vehicle and environmental conditions, a third wipe a few seconds later. You can also press and hold the wiper button for a continuous spray of washer fluid—the wipers perform the wipes after you release.

NOTE: The Auto setting is currently in BETA. If uncertain about using the Auto setting while in the BETA phase, Tesla recommends operating the wipers manually, as necessary.

Choose to heat the wiper blade by touching the windshield icon on the touchscreen.

While driving in the rain, the wiper blade may pause in the horizontal position for approximately 30 seconds before continuing to wipe the windshield. The blade may also move slightly based on vehicle speed to make Cybertruck more aerodynamic.

Periodically check and clean the edge of the wiper blade. If a blade is damaged, replace it immediately. For details on checking and replacing the wiper blade, see Windshield Wiper Blade, Jets and Fluid on page 208.

NOTE: If you choose Auto and the ability to detect liquid on the windshield becomes unavailable, the wiper setting reverts to the most recently used manual setting. If a manual setting cannot be determined, the wiper turns off.

NOTE: You can also adjust the windshield wiper speed and frequency using voice commands (see Voice Commands on page 25).

CAUTION: To avoid the risk of damaging the wiper, do not leave the wiper set to Auto when washing Cybertruck.

CAUTION: Remove ice from the windshield before turning the wiper on. Ice has sharp edges that can damage the rubber on the wiper blade. In harsh climates, ensure that the wiper blade is not frozen or adhered to the windshield.

Whenever you press the wiper button on the steering wheel, the touchscreen displays the wiper menu, allowing you to adjust wiper settings. Roll the left scroll button on the steering wheel up or down to choose your desired setting.

- Turn the wiper off.
- Choose how you want the wiper to operate:
  - I - Intermittent, slow.
  - II - Intermittent, fast.
  - III - Continuous, slow.
  - IIII - Continuous, fast.
  - Auto - Cybertruck detects precipitation and adjusts the wiping speed and intensity.
    NOTE: Turning on Autopilot features automatically sets wipers to Auto.

# Braking and Stopping

## Braking Systems

WARNING: Properly functioning braking systems are critical to ensure safety. If you experience a problem with the brake pedal, brake calipers, or any component of a Cybertruck braking system, contact Tesla immediately.

Cybertruck has an anti-lock braking system (ABS) that prevents the wheels from locking when you apply brake pressure. This improves steering control during heavy braking in most road conditions because ABS constantly monitors the speed of each wheel and varies the brake pressure according to the grip available.

The alteration of brake pressure can be felt as a pulsing sensation through the brake pedal. This demonstrates that the ABS is operating and is not a cause for concern. Keep firm and steady pressure on the brake pedal while experiencing the pulsing.

| Region | ABS Indicator |
|--------|---------------|
| USA and Mexico | The ABS indicator briefly flashes amber on the touchscreen when you first start Cybertruck. If this indicator lights up at any other time, an ABS fault has occurred and the ABS is not operating. Contact Tesla. The braking system remains fully operational and is not affected by an ABS failure. However, braking distances may increase. Drive cautiously and avoid heavy braking. |
| Canada | The ABS indicator briefly flashes amber on the touchscreen when you first start Cybertruck. If this indicator lights up at any other time, an ABS fault has occurred and the ABS is not operating. Contact Tesla. The braking system remains fully operational and is not affected by an ABS failure. However, braking distances may increase. Drive cautiously and avoid heavy braking. |

| Region | Brake Indicator |
|--------|-----------------|
| USA and Mexico | If the touchscreen displays this red brake indicator at any time other than briefly when you first start Cybertruck, a brake system fault is detected, or the level of the brake fluid is low. Contact Tesla immediately. Apply steady pressure and keep the brake pedal firmly pressed to stop the vehicle when safe to do so. |
| Canada | If the touchscreen displays this red brake indicator at any time other than briefly when you first start Cybertruck, a brake system fault is detected, or the level of the brake fluid is low. Contact Tesla immediately. Apply steady pressure and keep the brake pedal firmly pressed to stop the vehicle when safe to do so. |

| Region | Brake Booster Fault Indicator |
|--------|------------------------------|
| USA and Mexico | The touchscreen displays this amber brake indicator if a brake booster fault is detected. Apply steady pressure and keep the brake pedal firmly pressed to stop the vehicle when safe to do so. Hydraulic Boost Compensation will be active (see Hydraulic Boost Compensation on page 87). |
| Canada | The touchscreen displays this amber brake indicator if a brake booster fault is detected. Apply steady pressure and keep the brake pedal firmly pressed to stop the vehicle when safe to do so. Hydraulic Boost Compensation will be active (see Hydraulic Boost Compensation on page 87). |

## Emergency Braking

In an emergency, fully press the brake pedal and maintain firm pressure, even on low traction surfaces. The ABS varies the braking pressure to each wheel depending on the amount of traction available. This prevents wheels from locking and ensures that you stop as safely as possible.

If an alternative method is needed to bring the vehicle to a stop, press and hold the Park button on the touchscreen's drive mode strip to apply the brakes and remove drive torque while the button is held. Touch Controls or press the brake pedal to display the drive mode strip.

WARNING: Do not pump the brake pedal. Doing so interrupts operation of the ABS and can increase braking distance.

WARNING: Always maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you and be aware of hazardous driving conditions. While the ABS can improve stopping distance, it cannot overcome the laws of physics. It also does not prevent the danger of hydroplaning (where a layer of water prevents direct contact between the tires and the road).

CAUTION: Automatic Emergency Braking (see Automatic Emergency Braking on page 144) may intervene to automatically brake in situations where a collision is considered imminent. Automatic Emergency Braking is not designed to prevent a collision. It is designed to minimize the impact of a frontal collision by attempting to reduce your driving speed. Depending on Automatic Emergency Braking to avoid a collision can result in serious injury or death.

CAUTION: In emergency situations, if the brakes are not functioning properly, press and hold the Park button on the overhead console or touchscreen to bring Cybertruck to a stop. Do not use this method to stop the vehicle unless absolutely necessary.

# Braking and Stopping

## Brake Disc Wiping

When cold and wet weather is detected, brake disc wiping repeatedly applies an imperceptible amount of brake force to remove water from the surface of the brake discs.

NOTE: Apply Brakes When Regenerative Braking is Limited may not operate if the brakes are extremely hot.

NOTE: Apply Brakes When Regenerative Braking is Limited is not available when Trailer Mode is engaged (see Towing a Trailer on page 110).

## Hydraulic Boost Compensation

Cybertruck is equipped with a brake booster that activates the brakes when the brake pedal is pressed. Hydraulic boost compensation provides mechanical assistance if the brake booster fails. If a brake booster failure is detected, the brake pedal feels stiffer to press and you may hear a sound when you press the brake pedal. To stop Cybertruck, apply steady force to the brake pedal without releasing or pumping. Drive cautiously and maintain a safe distance from other road users —brake pedal responsiveness and braking performance may be degraded.

## Hydraulic Fade Compensation

Hydraulic fade compensation assists in monitoring brake system pressure and ABS activity for instances of reduced brake performance. If reduced brake performance is detected (for example, as a result of brake fade, or cold or wet conditions), you may hear a sound, feel the brake pedal pull away from your foot, and notice a strong increase in braking. Brake as you normally would and continue to press the brake pedal without releasing or pumping the brakes.

⚠️ WARNING: Always maintain a safe driving distance from the vehicle in front of you and exercise caution when driving conditions are hazardous. Brake disc wiping and hydraulic fade compensation are NOT substitutes for adequately applying the brakes.

## Regenerative Braking

Whenever Cybertruck is moving and your foot is off the accelerator, regenerative braking slows down the vehicle and feeds any surplus power back to the Battery. By anticipating your stops and reducing or relieving pressure from the accelerator pedal to slow down, you can take advantage of regenerative braking to increase driving range.

Vehicle deceleration due to regenerative braking may vary depending on the current state of the Battery. For example, regenerative braking may be limited if the Battery is cold or is already fully charged.

To experience the same amount of deceleration whenever you release the accelerator pedal, regardless of the state of the Battery, you can choose to have the regular braking system automatically engage whenever regenerative braking is limited. Touch Controls > Dynamics > Apply Brakes When Regenerative Braking is Limited. When enabled, the brake pedal may move or feel stiffer when pressed. This is expected and does not change your ability to slow down Cybertruck.

The power meter (a thin vertical line next to the drive mode strip) displays real-time power usage:

[Image of power meter]

1. Shows power being output by the Battery, such as that used to accelerate the vehicle or to cool the cabin. When you press the accelerator pedal, the top half of the power meter fills with black (or white if the display is dark).

2. Represents power generated from regenerative braking, or power that captured from slowing down the vehicle. Power being fed back to the Battery displays in green whereas power used by the regular braking system displays in gray.

NOTE: Installing winter tires with aggressive compound and tread design may result in temporarily-reduced regenerative braking power. However, your vehicle is designed to continuously recalibrate itself, and after changing tires it will increasingly restore regenerative braking power after some straight-line accelerations. For most drivers this occurs after a short period of normal driving, but drivers who normally accelerate lightly may need to use slightly harder accelerations while the recalibration is in progress.

NOTE: If regenerative braking is aggressively slowing Cybertruck (such as when your foot is completely off the accelerator pedal at highway speeds), the exterior brake lights turn on to alert others that you are slowing down.

⚠️ WARNING: In snowy or icy conditions, Cybertruck may experience loss of traction during regenerative braking.

# Braking and Stopping

## Vehicle Hold

When Cybertruck is stopped, Vehicle Hold can continue to apply the brakes even after you remove your foot from the brake pedal and is automatically enabled any time the vehicle comes to a complete stop.

This indicator displays on the touchscreen whenever Vehicle Hold is actively holding Cybertruck while stopped.

To disengage Vehicle Hold, press the accelerator or brake pedal, or shift into Neutral.

NOTE: After actively braking Cybertruck for approximately ten minutes, Cybertruck shifts into Park and Vehicle Hold cancels. The parking brake is still applied. Cybertruck also shifts into Park if it detects that the driver has left the vehicle.

CAUTION: In the unlikely event that Cybertruck loses electrical power, you cannot access the touchscreen and are therefore unable to release the parking brake without first jump starting (see Jump Starting on page 238).

WARNING: In snowy or icy conditions the rear wheels may not have sufficient traction to prevent Cybertruck from sliding down a slope, particularly if not using winter tires. Avoid parking on hills in snowy or icy conditions. You are always responsible for parking safely.

WARNING: Your Cybertruck may display an alert if the road is too steep to safely park, or if the parking brakes are not properly engaged. These alerts are for guidance purposes only and are not a substitute for the driver's judgment of safe parking conditions, including specific road or weather conditions. Do not depend on these alerts to determine whether or not it is safe to park at any location. You are always responsible for parking safely.

## Parking Brake

The parking brake is automatically engaged when in Park, and automatically disengages when shifted out of Park.

To manually engage the parking brake, touch Controls > Safety > Park Brake. Follow the onscreen instructions. Manually disengage the parking brake by selecting Park Brake again.

USA and Mexico:
When you manually apply the parking brake using the touchscreen, the red parking brake indicator lights up on the touchscreen.

Canada:
When you manually apply the parking brake using the touchscreen, the red parking brake indicator lights up on the touchscreen.

USA and Mexico:
If the parking brake experiences an electrical issue, the amber parking brake indicator lights up and a fault message displays on the touchscreen.

Canada:
If the parking brake experiences an electrical issue, the amber parking brake indicator lights up and a fault message displays on the touchscreen.

NOTE: The parking brake operates on the rear wheels only, and is independent of the pedal-operated brake system.

## Brake Wear

Cybertruck brake pads are equipped with wear indicators. A wear indicator is a thin metal strip attached to the brake pad that squeals as it rubs against the rotor when the pad wears down. This squealing sound indicates that the brake pads have reached the end of their service life and require replacement.

Brakes must be periodically inspected visually by removing the tire and wheel. For detailed specifications and service limits for rotors and brake pads, see Subsystems on page 226. Additionally, Tesla recommends cleaning and lubricating the brake calipers every year or 12,500 miles (20,000 km) if in an area where roads are salted during winter months.

WARNING: Neglecting to replace worn brake pads damages the braking system and can result in a braking hazard.

# Park Assist

Cybertruck is designed to detect the presence of objects. When driving slowly (for example, when parking), the vehicle alerts you if an object is detected in close proximity of your Cybertruck. The vehicle alerts you when objects are detected in front of Cybertruck when you are in Drive, and behind Cybertruck when you are in Reverse.

⚠️ WARNING: You may not be alerted if Cybertruck rolls freely in the opposite direction (for example, Park Assist does not display an alert if Cybertruck rolls backwards down a hill while in Drive).

NOTE: Park Assist may be disabled when a bicycle is detected, when the tailgate is down, or when Cybertruck is in trailer mode.

⚠️ WARNING: Never depend on Park Assist to inform you if an area you are approaching is free of objects and/or people. Several external factors can reduce the performance of Park Assist, causing either no readings or false readings (see Limitations and False Warnings on page 89). Therefore, depending on Park Assist to determine if Cybertruck is approaching an obstruction can result in damage to the vehicle and/or objects, and can potentially cause serious injury. Always inspect the area with your own eyes. When reversing, perform shoulder checks and use all mirrors. Park assist does not detect children, pedestrians, bicyclists, animals, or objects that are moving, protruding, located too far above or below the cameras, or too close or too far from the cameras. Park Assist is for guidance purposes only and is not intended to replace your own direct visual checks. It is not a substitute for careful driving.

## Tesla Vision Park Assist

NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be equipped with Tesla Vision Park Assist.

Your vehicle uses the cameras mounted on the front, rear, and sides of Cybertruck to create a high-fidelity reproduction of surrounding objects on the touchscreen.

The colors on the visualization correspond to the distance between Cybertruck and the object shown. Red is closer to Cybertruck, and yellow is farther from Cybertruck.

## Visual and Audio Feedback

When you shift to Reverse, the Park Assist view displays on the touchscreen, showing objects that are in close proximity to the front and rear of Cybertruck. This view closes when you shift into Drive unless an object is detected close to the front of Cybertruck, in which case the Park Assist view closes automatically when you start driving faster than the speed at which Park Assist operates. When reversing, visual feedback also displays on the touchscreen (see Rear-Facing Camera on page 27). You can manually close the park assist view on the touchscreen by touching the X.

When driving at low speeds with the Camera app displayed on the touchscreen, you can switch to the Park Assist view by touching the button located in the upper left corner of the Camera app screen. This is useful if you need assistance with parallel parking.

If chimes are turned on (see Controlling Audible Feedback on page 89), an audible beep sounds as you approach an object.

NOTE: If Park Assist is unable to provide feedback, the displays an alert message.

⚠️ CAUTION: Keep cameras clean from dirt, debris, snow, and ice. Avoid using a high pressure power washer on the cameras, and do not clean a camera with a sharp or abrasive object that can scratch or damage its surface.

⚠️ CAUTION: Do not install accessories or stickers on or near the cameras.

## Controlling Audible Feedback

You can use Park Assist with or without audible feedback. To turn chimes on or off, touch Controls > Safety > Park Assist Chimes.

## Limitations and False Warnings

Park Assist may not function correctly in these situations:

- One or more of the sensors (if equipped) or cameras is damaged, dirty, or obstructed (such as by mud, ice, or snow, or by a vehicle bra, excessive paint, or adhesive products such as wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.).
- The object is located below approximately 8 inches (20 cm) (such as a curb or low barrier).

⚠️ CAUTION: Shorter objects that are detected (such as curbs or low barriers) can move into a blind spot. Cybertruck cannot alert you about an object while it is in a blind spot.

- Weather conditions (heavy rain, snow, or fog).
- The object is thin (such as a sign post).
- Park Assist's operating range has been exceeded.
- The object is sound-absorbing or soft (such as powder snow).
- The object is sloped (such as a sloped embankment).
- Cybertruck has been parked in, or being driven in, extremely hot or cold temperatures.
- The object is located too close to the bumper.
- A bumper is misaligned or damaged.
- An object that is mounted to Cybertruck is interfering with and/or obstructing Park Assist (such as a bike rack or bumper sticker).
---
# Park Assist

- Cybertruck rolls freely in the opposite direction you selected (for example, Park Assist does not display an alert if Cybertruck rolls backwards down a hill while in Drive).

## Other Parking Aids

In addition to Park Assist, when shifted into Reverse, the backup camera displays a view of the area behind Cybertruck (see Rear-Facing Camera on page 27).
---
# Traction Control

## How It Works

The traction control system constantly monitors the speed of the front and rear wheels. If Cybertruck experiences a loss of traction, your vehicle minimizes wheel spin by controlling brake pressure and motor power. By default, the traction control system is on. Under normal conditions, it should remain on to ensure maximum safety.

NOTE: When Cybertruck is in an Off-Road Drive Mode, the traction control system may be disabled or operate differently. For more information about customizing the traction control system while driving off road, see Off-Road Driving on page 100.

This yellow indicator flashes on the touchscreen whenever the traction control system is actively controlling brake pressure and motor power to minimize wheel spin. If the indicator stays on, a fault is detected with the traction control system. Use the mobile app to schedule a service appointment.

⚠️ WARNING: Traction control cannot prevent collisions caused by driving dangerously or turning too sharply at high speeds.

## Slippery Surfaces

Your vehicle can distribute traction evenly across all tires to provide more traction and stability during slippery conditions, such as rain, snow, or ice. To enable, go to Controls > Dynamics > Slippery Surface.

NOTE: Even when this setting is Off, Cybertruck continuously detects characteristics of the current driving surface and automatically adapts Traction Control.

# Suspension

Cybertruck is equipped with adaptive air suspension that offers superior ride quality, balances comfort with range and performance, and maintains a level height between the front and rear axles.

You can manually adjust the ride height to suit your circumstances. For example, you can raise Cybertruck when you need extra ground clearance (such as when driving on a steep driveway or ramp, in deep snow, over large speed bumps, parking curbs, etc.) or temporarily lower Cybertruck when you need extra space above the vehicle (such as in a parking garage) or to increase handling and range.

NOTE: When Cybertruck starts, you may hear the sound of the compressor as the air suspension system's reservoir fills with air.

⚠️ CAUTION: Before adjusting the ride height, ensure Cybertruck is clear of all obstacles, above and below.

You can adjust the ride height by touching Controls. The available ride height settings depend on your driving speed and other conditions, such as the current drive mode. You can also adjust the ride height by touching Ride Height on the exterior view of Cybertruck in the vehicle status area of the touchscreen when Cybertruck is parked.

NOTE: When you change the ride height from Controls, it will automatically lower or raise to the preferred ride height again once your driving speed exceeds 25 mph (40 km/h).

🔺 If a fault is detected that reduces the performance of the adaptive air suspension system, a yellow indicator lights up on the touchscreen. If the problem persists, use the mobile app to schedule a service appointment.

🔺 If a fault is detected that disables the adaptive air suspension system, a red indicator lights up on the touchscreen. Use the mobile app to schedule a service appointment.

## Ride Height Settings - On-Road

The following ride height settings are meant for day-to-day driving when Cybertruck is in an on-road drive mode. For more information on customizing the preferred ride height, see On-Road Modes on page 95.

NOTE: Each ride height is shown in relation to Medium, which is considered to be 0 in. (0 mm).

| Setting | Change in Height | Description |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| High | 2.4 in. (6 cm) above Medium | When the ride height is set to High, it automatically returns to the preferred ride height* after driving approximately 100 ft. (30 meters) or when your driving speed reaches 25 mph (40 km/h). |
| Low | 1.6 in. (4 cm) below Medium | When the ride height is set to Low, it automatically returns to the preferred ride height* after driving approximately 100 ft. (30 meters) or when your driving speed reaches 25 mph (40 km/h). |
| Entry | 2.2 in. (5.5 cm) below Medium | When the ride height is set to Entry, it automatically returns to the preferred ride height* once your driving speed exceeds 10 mph (16 km/h). When Auto Lower is enabled, Cybertruck lowers to the Entry setting when in Park to make it easier to enter or exit the vehicle (see Auto Lower on page 93). |

* To change the preferred ride height, touch Controls > Dynamics > Preferred Ride Height. For more information, see On-Road Modes on page 95.

# Suspension

## Ride Height Settings - Off-Road

The following ride height settings are available when Cybertruck is in an off-road drive mode. For more information about driving off-road, see Off-Road Driving on page 100.

NOTE: Each ride height is shown in relation to Medium, which is considered to be 0 in. (0 mm).

| Setting | Change in Height | Description |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| Extract | 5.9 in. (15 cm) above Medium | Extract is the maximum ride height, designed for use when Cybertruck is stuck on an underbody obstacle. This is only available in certain off-road modes.<br><br>When the ride height is set to Extract, vehicle speed is limited to 10 mph (16 km/h), and torque may be limited. The ride height automatically resets to Very High once your driving speed exceeds 10 mph (16 km/h). |
| Very High | 3.9 in. (10 cm) above Medium | Very High increases ground clearance and improves approach, breakover, and departure angles while off-road driving. When the ride height is set to Very High, vehicle speed is limited to 25 mph (40 km/h). The ride height automatically resets to High when your driving speed exceeds 25 mph (40 km/h). |
| High | 2.4 in. (6 cm) above Medium | High increases ground clearance to suit general off-road driving at both low and high speeds. |

## Auto Lower

To make it easier to get into Cybertruck, enable Auto Lower (Controls > Dynamics > Auto Lower). Once enabled, your vehicle automatically adjusts to the Entry ride height whenever your vehicle shifts into Park.

The suspension automatically raises back to your preferred ride height when you resume driving.

CAUTION: When Auto Lower is enabled and you are parking Cybertruck, ensure that there are no obstacles underneath the vehicle that may contact the underbody when the suspension lowers.

NOTE: Auto Lower is not available while in Off-Road Mode.

NOTE: You can also make it easier to enter and exit Cybertruck by enabling Easy Entry. When Easy Entry is enabled, the steering wheel and driver's seat adjust automatically when the vehicle is in Park to allow more room for entering or exiting the vehicle (see Easy Entry on page 97).

## Self-Leveling

To prevent damage when jacking or lifting the vehicle, you must activate Jack Mode to disable self-leveling. For more details, see Jack Mode on page 211.

## Auto-Raising Locations

Whenever you raise the suspension, your vehicle saves the suspension setting based on the location. By saving the location, you do not need to manually raise the suspension every time you arrive at a frequently-used location where you have previously raised the suspension. When you return to the saved location, Cybertruck raises the suspension and the touchscreen displays a message indicating that the suspension is adjusting.

When returning to a saved location and driving faster than the suspension settings allow, the suspension does not adjust until the vehicle slows down. For example, if you set the suspension to always raise on a particular street to account for speed bumps, but you are traveling at more than 25 mph (40 km/h) when you reach that location, the ride height is not raised until your speed falls below 25 mph (40 km/h).

Driving 93
---
# Suspension

If Cybertruck reaches a saved location and the existing suspension setting is already higher than the level that has been saved for that location, the ride height is not adjusted. After leaving a saved location, the suspension automatically lowers to the preferred ride height. However, it may not lower until your vehicle meets the speed and distance threshold at which the suspension lowers.

NOTE: Cybertruck may not raise the suspension in a saved location where connectivity is poor (for example, in an underground parking garage).

## To remove an auto-raising location

If no longer want the suspension to automatically raise at a location, touch to deselect Always raise at this location in the popup that appears when you arrive at a saved location.

# On-Road Modes

To choose how Cybertruck accelerates and handles for day-to-day driving on public roads, touch Controls > Dynamics.

Choose between three Drive Modes. Comfort and Sport automatically set the Acceleration, Ride & Handling, and Preferred Ride Height to balance ride comfort, handling, and range. Custom allows you to customize these options as you see fit.

To access additional performance and acceleration, select Beast (if equipped) and follow the on-screen prompts.

In addition, you can choose to enable Auto Shift out of Park (see Shifting on page 73) or Auto Lower (see Suspension on page 92).

## Customization Options

| Setting | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Acceleration | Chill | Limits acceleration for a smooth and gentle ride. When Chill is selected, Chill displays on the touchscreen above the driving speed. |
| | Standard | Provides the normal level of acceleration. |
| Ride & Handling | Relaxed | Prioritizes comfort over dynamic handling response. Cybertruck will feel smoother and more comfortable, especially on rough or uneven roads. |
| | Focused | Provides higher damping for more dynamic driving. Cybertruck will feel more responsive and connected to the road. |
| Preferred Ride Height | Lower | Sets the Preferred Ride Height to Lower. The ride height remains at Low on and off the highway by default, optimizing handling and range (see Suspension on page 92). |
| | Higher | Sets the Preferred Ride Height to Higher. When set to Higher, the ride height automatically adjusts between Medium and Low to balance ride comfort with handling and range. On highways or while driving at highway speeds, ride height adjusts to Low (see Suspension on page 92). |

> **CAUTION:** Do not use off-road locking differentials while driving on high-traction surfaces, such as asphalt. Using locking differentials in inappropriate situations can cause significant damage to the vehicle. Damage to the vehicle due to improper use of locking differentials is not covered by the warranty.

# Driver Profiles

When you first adjust the driver's seat, steering wheel position, or exterior side mirrors, the touchscreen prompts you to create a driver profile to save these adjustments. Your profile also saves various preferences you make while customizing Cybertruck.

To save your profile settings to the cloud and access them across multiple Tesla vehicles, set up a Tesla Profile (see Using Tesla Profiles on page 96).

To add a new driver profile, touch the driver profile icon in Controls. Then touch Driver Profile Settings > Add New Driver, type the driver's name and touch Create Profile. Follow the onscreen instructions to save mirror and steering wheel position to the driver profile.

Check the Use Easy Entry checkbox if you want to save (or use existing) Easy Entry settings in which the driver's seat and the steering wheel are automatically adjusted to make it easy to enter and exit Cybertruck.

If you change the position of the driver's seat, steering wheel, or exterior side mirrors after you have saved or chosen a driver profile, the touchscreen prompts you to Save the new position or Restore the previously saved position (other settings are automatically saved). To change a setting without saving or restoring, just ignore the prompt.

To delete a driver profile, touch the driver profile icon in Controls, touch Driver Profile Settings and select the driver profile you want to remove. Once selected, Delete the driver profile.

NOTE: Valet mode is a built-in driver profile that limits speed and restricts access to some Cybertruck features (see Valet Mode on page 97).

NOTE: To stop automatic adjustments that are in process based on a driver's profile, touch Stop on the Driver Profile dropdown menu. Automatic adjustments also stop if you manually adjust a seat, mirror, or the steering wheel.

## Selecting Between Driver Profiles

To adjust Cybertruck based on a driver's profile, touch the driver profile icon at the top of the Controls screen. Then choose the driver, and Cybertruck is adjusted based on the settings that have been saved to the chosen driver profile. See Using Tesla Profiles on page 96 to learn more about saving profile settings to the cloud for easy access across multiple Tesla vehicles.

## Using Tesla Profiles

Driver profile settings, such as seat adjustments, temperature preferences, navigation Recents and Favorites, media settings, and data sharing preferences can be saved into a Tesla Profile that is synced to every supported vehicle under your Tesla Account. This provides convenient access to your profile settings and preferences across all your Tesla supported vehicles.

To set up your Tesla Profile, navigate to Driver Profile Settings and select your Tesla Account name. You can choose to set it up as a New Profile or copy the settings from an existing driver profile that you were previously using.

To set up a Tesla Profile for additional drivers, share your vehicle with them from the mobile app and navigate to Security & Drivers > Manage Drivers > Add Driver. Their Tesla Profile will appear in the Driver Profile settings after accepting the invitation from their Tesla Account. If you remove their access to the vehicle, it also removes their Tesla Profile. For more information on granting mobile app access, see Granting Access to a Second Driver on page 65. In addition, you can change your profile picture from your Tesla Mobile App.

NOTE: Some vehicle settings, such as seat, mirror, steering wheel, and air vent positions are only synced between the same vehicle models. If the seat or steering positions do not restore as expected, touch Controls > Service > Seat & Steering Calibration on the affected vehicles.

To remove your Tesla Profile from a vehicle, remove that vehicle from your Tesla account:

1. In the Tesla mobile app, touch the profile icon in the top-right corner.
2. Touch Add/Remove Products.
3. Touch Remove.
4. Select the vehicle you'd like to remove.

## Saved Settings

A subset of the settings that you choose to customize your Cybertruck are automatically saved to your driver's profile. Once saved, a green check mark appears next to the driver profile icon on the touchscreen. Examples of automatically saved driver profile settings are:

- Navigation, temperature, lights and display settings.
- Autopilot and driving preferences.

## Linking a Driver Profile to a Key

You can link a driver profile to a key (or keys) to allow Cybertruck to automatically select the correct driver profile when the linked key is detected as you approach the vehicle and open the driver's door. To link a driver profile to a key, first ensure you are using your desired driver profile, then touch Controls > Locks > Keys. You can toggle the driver icon

# Driver Profiles

to link or delete a key to the desired driver profile. The name of the driver profile appears under the key to show that it is linked.

NOTE: Cybertruck supports up to 10 driver profiles. You can link multiple keys to a driver profile, but you cannot link multiple driver profiles to a single key.

## Easy Entry

You can define an Easy Entry setting that moves the steering wheel and driver's seat to make it easy to enter and exit Cybertruck. Any driver can use the Easy Entry setting by associating it with their driver profile. When the Easy Entry setting is associated with a driver profile, the steering wheel and driver's seat automatically adjust when in Park and the driver's seat belt is unbuckled, allowing an easy exit from (and next entrance into) Cybertruck. When returning to the vehicle and stepping on the brake pedal, settings automatically adjust back to the settings used by the most recent driver profile (or based on the key if it's linked to a driver profile).

To use Easy Entry with a driver profile, ensure the Use Easy Entry box is checked.

WARNING: Never use Easy Entry to move the driver's seat to the full rearward position when a child safety seat is installed on a rear seat located behind the driver's seat. With reduced clearance, the movement of the seat may impact a child's legs, cause injury, or dislodge the seat.

NOTE: You can also make it easier to enter or exit Cybertruck by enabling Auto Lower. For more information, see Auto Lower on page 93.

## Valet Mode

When Cybertruck is in Valet mode, the following restrictions apply:

- Key card must be used to access and drive Cybertruck.
- Speed is limited to 70 mph (113 km/h).
- Maximum acceleration and power are limited.
- Front trunk and glovebox are locked.
- Home and Work locations are not available in the navigation system.
- Voice commands are disabled.
- Autopilot convenience features are disabled.
- The Allow Mobile Access setting cannot be changed.
- Driver Profiles are not accessible.
- Some apps, such as Toybox and Theater, are not accessible.
- The touchscreen does not display the list of keys that can access Cybertruck (see Managing Keys on page 31).
- Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are disabled. When Cybertruck is in Valet mode, you cannot pair new Bluetooth devices or view or delete existing paired devices. However, if a Bluetooth-paired device or a known Wi-Fi network is within range, Cybertruck connects to it.

### Starting Valet Mode

With Cybertruck in Park, touch the driver profile icon at the top of the Controls screen, then touch Valet Mode.

The first time you enter Valet mode, the touchscreen prompts you to create a 4-digit PIN you will use to cancel Valet mode.

When Valet mode is active, the touchscreen displays the word Valet while the driver profile changes to Valet Mode on the touchscreen.

You can also use the mobile app to start and cancel Valet mode (if Cybertruck is in Park). When using the mobile app, you do not need to enter a PIN because you are already required to log into the app using your Tesla Account credentials.

NOTE: If PIN to Drive is enabled (see PIN to Drive on page 148), you must enter the driving PIN before you can define or enter a Valet PIN. Once in Valet mode, Cybertruck can be driven without the valet needing to enter the driving PIN.

NOTE: The PIN to Drive setting is not available when Valet mode is active.

If you forget your valet PIN, reset it from inside Cybertruck by entering your Tesla Account credentials (which also cancels Valet mode). You can also reset your PIN using the mobile app.

WARNING: Do not use Valet mode when towing a trailer. The torque limitations of Valet mode can make it difficult for Cybertruck to pull a trailer up a hill.

### Canceling Valet Mode

With Cybertruck in Park, touch the Valet Mode driver profile icon at the top of the Controls screen, and enter your 4-digit PIN.

When you cancel Valet mode, all settings associated with the most recently used driver profile and climate control settings are restored, and all features are available.

# Pedestrian Warning System

The Pedestrian Warning System causes Cybertruck to emit sound when driving below approximately 25 mph (40 km/h) or while driving in reverse. Electric vehicles operate quietly and this sound helps to alert pedestrians of your oncoming vehicle. The sound, which activates whenever Cybertruck is shifted out of Park, gets louder as speed increases.

⚠️ WARNING: If sound cannot be heard, pedestrians may not be aware of your oncoming vehicle, which may increase the likelihood of a collision resulting in serious injury or death. Never rely on the Pedestrian Warning System to make sure that pedestrians are aware of your vehicle. If the Pedestrian Warning System is not operating, schedule a service appointment.

# Off-Road Driving

Off-road driving is driving your vehicle on an unpaved surface such as sand, silt, dirt, or mud, or on rocky or snow-covered surfaces. When Cybertruck is in Off-Road Mode, you have access to settings and drive modes that allow you to manage steep ascents, descents, uneven terrain, shallow creeks, and other obstacles you may encounter.

The Off-Road app provides greater control over traction, stability, acceleration, and braking. Various modes and settings also allow you to quickly adjust the ride height of Cybertruck (see Suspension on page 92).

> CAUTION: Carefully read all cautions and warnings before driving Cybertruck off road (see Limitations and Warnings on page 109). Always pay close attention and monitor the area to the front, rear, and sides of Cybertruck for obstacles while off-road driving.

> CAUTION: Any damage caused by off-road driving is not covered by the warranty.

Off-Road Modes and settings include the following:

- Overland: Maximizes traction on various terrains at low speeds. See Overland on page 102.
- Baja: Optimizes the suspension and traction control of Cybertruck for high speed driving on dirt roads or desert environments. See Baja on page 102.
- Wade Mode: Raises the suspension and pressurizes the high voltage Battery to protect your vehicle from water and debris while navigating shallow bodies of water. See Wade Mode on page 103.
- Trail Assist: Allows you to maintain your speed while driving on a trail. See Trail Assist on page 104.
- Locking Differentials: Engage for more traction while off-roading. See Locking Differentials on page 105.

## Using the Off-Road App

> WARNING: Only use Off-Road mode in off-road driving scenarios. Off-Road modes change how Cybertruck handles, accelerates, and decelerates, and is not appropriate for public roads.

Use the Off-Road app, located in the app tray, to conveniently customize and monitor your off-road settings. After carefully reading the pop-up window, touch Confirm.

In the Off-Road app, customize options such as:

- Off-Road Mode: Choose between Overland and Baja and customize your preferences. See Overland on page 102 and Baja on page 102 for more information.
- Locking Differentials: Engage or disengage locking differentials. See Locking Differentials on page 105.
- Pitch, Roll: These angles determine how capable the vehicle is of climbing over an obstacle or up an incline.

NOTE: If you are approaching a large obstacle or change in incline, you can set the right ride height to Extract by touching Controls > Ride Height > Extract. When the ride height is set to Extract, Cybertruck has increased approach, breakover, and departure angles.

- Wade Mode: See Wade Mode on page 103 for more information.
- Rear Steer: You can set Rear Steer to Off or Auto. Auto allows for a tighter turn radius while driving.
- Light Bar: Enable or disable the light bar, if installed.
- Ride Height: Customize your vehicle's ride height based on terrain and other drive settings. See Suspension on page 92.

NOTE: Cybertruck must be in Park to change the off-road drive modes and settings.

NOTE: Your off-road settings remain for approximately 15 minutes after you exit the vehicle. Always double check to ensure your off-road settings are as intended prior to driving.

> CAUTION: The TPMS warning thresholds may be lowered to accommodate different off-road needs. Do not rely solely on the TPMS warning indicator when in an Off-Road mode or setting, as these thresholds do not comply with Federal TPMS standards. It is your responsibility to ensure tires are adequately inflated at all times and are inflated back to normal levels before regular driving on roads.

## Before Off-Road Driving

1. Plan your route: Carefully consult maps and weather reports before beginning an off-road expedition and familiarize yourself with the different types of terrain you may encounter (gravel, sand, mud, snow, etc.). Research trails before setting out and be aware that weather and environmental conditions can change quickly and unexpectedly. Ensure your vehicle has ample range for your planned route.

2. Secure passengers and cargo: Wearing a seat belt is required by law. Ensure that all passengers are wearing their seat belts properly (see Seat Belts on page 39). Make sure that loose items in the cabin are stowed or secured, and ensure that the cargo bed is free of cargo, or that cargo is tightly secured. The tonneau cover can be open or closed while driving off road.

3. Evenly distribute vehicle load: While off-road driving, Cybertruck performs best when the weight of passengers and cargo is distributed evenly across the front and rear axles (see Vehicle Loading on page 218). Detach large or heavily loaded trailers before driving off road.

4. Lower tire pressure: Lower tire pressure to increase traction on softer surfaces such as sand or gravel, and on rocky surfaces. Reducing tire pressure allows tires to make more contact with the terrain, increasing grip and decreasing the risk of punctures.
---
# Off-Road Driving

⚠️ WARNING: Avoid making hard turns and other sudden maneuvers when tires are inflated under the recommended cold tire pressure. Before driving on public roads again, make sure to fill all tires to the recommended cold tire pressure (see Tire Pressures on page 195).

5. Be prepared: Equip your Cybertruck with supplies in case of emergency, such as a spare tire, a jack, an air compressor, a portable jump starter, and a flashlight.

6. Remove wheel fairings: Cybertruck has pieces of plastic trim that descend in front of the wheels from the rocker panels on either side of the vehicle. These are the wheel fairings. The wheel fairings increase aerodynamic performance and range, but may be damaged while driving off-road over rough, uneven surfaces, rocks, or obstacles. To prevent damage, remove the front wheel fairings before off-road driving. For more information and instructions for removing the wheel fairings, refer to the Do It Yourself Guide (see Do It Yourself Maintenance on page 216).

7. Remove wheel covers: To prevent damage, remove the wheel covers before driving off-road. For more information, see Removing and Installing Wheel Covers on page 199.

## While Off-Road Driving

Quickly access off-road settings and vitals from Cybertruck in the vehicle status area on the touchscreen. You can also keep the Off-Road app open while driving to quickly change settings and preferences based on your driving situation. See quick stats such as:

- Off-Road Status icons
- Tire Pressures
- Locking Differential status
- Battery and motor temperatures
- Ride Height

NOTE: When the ride height is set to Extract, vehicle speed is limited to 10 mph (16 km/h), and torque may be limited. The ride height automatically resets to Very High once your driving speed exceeds 10 mph (16 km/h).

If your vehicle is covered in mud after off-roading, rinse the entire exterior of the vehicle with water. It is important to regularly clean Cybertruck after off-roading because mud and debris can quickly build up and limit some vehicle functions. See Cleaning Mud on page 191 for more information.

⚠️ CAUTION: Tesla recommends to fully open the tonneau to accommodate for increased body flex during dynamic off-road driving.

# Off-Road Modes

## Overland

Overland maximizes traction on various terrains at low speeds. By selecting Overland, you can customize the following settings:

| Setting | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Surface | All Purpose | Automatically adjusts tire slip based on the amount of available traction and sets the Preferred Ride Height to High. All Purpose is best suited for mixed terrain driving. |
| | Sand | Allows for high amounts of tire slip to provide optimal traction on soft, deformable surfaces like sand and sets the Preferred Ride Height to High. |
| | Gravel/ Deep Snow | Allows for medium amounts of tire slip to provide optimal traction on gravel or deep snow, and sets the Preferred Ride Height to High. |
| | Rock | Tightly manages tire slip to maximize grip in rock crawl conditions and sets the Preferred Ride Height to Very High. When the ride height is Very High, the suspension system pneumatically connects the springs on the front and rear axles, increasing suspension articulation for maximum traction. |
| Stopping Mode | Hold | Applies the brakes automatically when Cybertruck stops, without you having to put your foot on the brake pedal. Whether stopped on a flat surface or a hill, Vehicle Hold keeps the brake applied, provided your foot remains off the accelerator and brake pedals. |
| | | WARNING: Never rely on Hold to adequately decelerate or fully stop your vehicle. Many factors can contribute to a longer stopping distance, including downward slopes, and reduced or limited regenerative braking (see Regenerative Braking on page 87). Always be prepared to use the brake pedal to adequately decelerate or stop. |
| | Roll | Allows Cybertruck to roll freely when close to, or at, a complete stop, like a vehicle in Neutral. Therefore, if stopped on a slope, Cybertruck will roll downward. The brake does not engage, and the motors do not apply torque (until the accelerator pedal is pressed). |

## Baja

When Cybertruck is in Baja, the ride height raises and adaptive damping dynamically adjusts based on your Terrain selection to optimize performance on various off-road scenarios. The electronic stability control system also allows more tire slip on low-traction surfaces. This is especially useful in high speed driving situations, such as desert or sand driving.

You can customize the following settings:

| Setting | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Handling Balance | Left | Adjusts the vehicle balance such that Cybertruck behaves more like a front-wheel-drive vehicle. When you move the slider to the left, Cybertruck is more stable and is more susceptible to understeer (when you turn the wheel and Cybertruck turns less than normal). |
| | Right | Adjusts the vehicle balance such that Cybertruck behaves more like a rear-wheel-drive vehicle. When you move the slider to the right, Cybertruck moves with more agility but less stability, and is susceptible to oversteer (when you turn the wheel and Cybertruck turns more than normal). |
| Stability Assist | Standard | Provides the maximum amount of stability control intervention*. |
| | Reduced | Reduces the amount of stability control intervention. |
| | Minimal | Provides a minimal amount of stability control intervention. |
| | | WARNING: Drive with caution when customizing Stability Assist. If you lose control of Cybertruck, less stability control intervention will be applied and the vehicle may not stabilize itself. Use only if you have advanced experience driving beyond grip limits. |
| Terrain | Smooth | Sets ride height to Medium and increases damping for greater body control and responsive handling. Best for drifting or high-speed driving on smooth or flat terrains (see Suspension on page 92). |
| | Rugged | Sets ride height to High with damping optimized for rough terrain, medium-sized obstacles, and whoops. |
| | Clearance | Sets ride height to Very High for traversing large obstacles. |

102 Owner's Manual
---
# Off-Road Modes

| Setting | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Deceleration Mode | High | Increases the amount of regenerative braking so Cybertruck slows down more dramatically when you remove your foot from the accelerator pedal, allowing for more dynamic one-pedal driving. |
| | | ⚠️ WARNING: Setting the Deceleration Mode to High (located in Dynamics) may cause some loss of traction on loose surfaces (such as snow). |
| | Standard | Provides the normal level of regenerative braking, allowing Cybertruck to maintain traction on loose, low-traction surfaces (such as sand, dirt, and gravel). |

\* Stability control intervention modifies motor torque and selectively applies the brakes to each wheel to make Cybertruck more stable and help the driver maintain control of the vehicle. In this setting, stability control is reduced compared to on-road driving.

## Wade Mode

Wade Mode allows Cybertruck to enter and drive through bodies of water, such as rivers or creeks.

⚠️ CAUTION: It is your responsibility to gauge the depth of any body of water before entering. Damage or water ingress to Cybertruck as a result of driving in water is not covered by the warranty.

⚠️ CAUTION: Always inspect underwater conditions (such as debris, etc.) before entering and use your best judgment. Take care to drive slowly and safely. If the water is too deep, return to more shallow water or dry land.

[An image shows a side view of the Cybertruck driving through water. A zoomed-in view of the wheel is shown, with a measurement indicator.]

1. The maximum wade depth is approximately 32 in. (815 mm) measuring from the bottom of the tire.

Wade Mode must be used any time you are driving Cybertruck through a shallow body of water, such as a river. To enable Wade Mode:

1. Ensure all doors and windows are fully closed, and your vehicle speed is less than 20 mph (32 km/h).
2. Access the Off-Road App.
3. Select Wade.

Off-Roading                                                                                                                                          103
---
# Off-Road Modes

When enabled, the Wade Mode icon appears on the touchscreen and starts a countdown for how long Wade Mode is active. Wade Mode duration is limited to 30 minutes.

Wade Mode defaults the vehicle's ride height to Very High and protects Cybertruck for up to approximately 32 in (815 mm) of water, driving at slow speeds (1-3 mph (2-5 km/h)). As water depth changes, reduce your vehicle speed accordingly. Do not disable Wade Mode until your vehicle is fully out of water.

In addition, the vehicle's high voltage Battery automatically pressurizes to protect the Battery from water and debris.

Muddy waters can reduce the cooling system effectiveness by adhering to the radiator. See Cleaning Mud on page 191 for information on how to clean your vehicle after a muddy excursion. Wash your vehicle immediately after wading to reduce chances of bacteria buildup and mud hardening after drying. Vehicles driving in waters should be regularly inspected for signs of water ingress or damage to components including (but not limited to) the brakes, horn, lights, etc.

⚠️ CAUTION: On soft or muddy underwater surfaces, Cybertruck may sink in, effectively increasing the water level on the vehicle. Take this possibility into account and prepare accordingly.

⚠️ WARNING: Never stop or place the vehicle in Park when crossing water. Do not drive in water next to, or immediately after, another vehicle. Currents created by other vehicles can lead to damage.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not drive in deep, fast-flowing bodies of water (such as strong currents or rapids). Doing so can result in damage, serious injury, or death.

# Trail Assist

Trail Assist is available when Cybertruck is in Overland. It maintains the speed of the vehicle to provide greater control during steep ascents and descents.

To enable, touch Controls > Dynamics > Off-Road > Trail Assist. Then you can quickly activate or deactivate Trail Assist when needed by single-clicking the right scroll wheel button. You can set the Trail Assist speed between 1 mph (2 km/h) and 25 mph (40 km/h). When active, you can change the set speed by swiping on the right scroll wheel. Small swipes increase the speed in smaller increments, whereas large swipes increase the speed in larger increments.

You can also press the accelerator or brake pedal to temporarily increase or decrease your speed. Once you remove your foot from the pedal, the vehicle returns to your set speed. If you simultaneously brake to a lower speed and swipe down on the right scroll wheel, or accelerate and swipe up, the set speed will automatically snap to the current speed.

NOTE: Unlike other features that allow you to set a cruising speed (such as Traffic-Aware Cruise Control), pressing the brake pedal does not disable Trail Assist. However, pressing and holding the brake pedal firmly while at a standstill disables Trail Assist.

NOTE: Trail Assist disengages and returns to your normal driving settings if you accelerate above 30 mph (48 km/h). It re-activates when you drive below 30 mph (48 km/h).

⚠️ CAUTION: Trail Assist does not detect objects in front of the vehicle. It is your responsibility to always monitor your vehicle's surroundings and be prepared to brake or steer for unanticipated circumstances.

# Locking Differentials

CAUTION: Do not use off-road locking differentials while driving on high-traction surfaces, such as asphalt. Using locking differentials in inappropriate situations can cause significant damage to the vehicle. Damage to the vehicle due to improper use of locking differentials is not covered by the warranty.

## Open Differentials

Most passenger vehicles are equipped with open differentials on the drive axles. When a vehicle with open differentials turns on a corner or paved road, the wheels on the outside of the curve rotate more quickly than the wheels on the inside of the curve to prevent wheel hop and reduce vehicle instability. However, in low-traction scenarios (such as off-roading or driving in snow), additional torque can get directed towards the wheel(s) with less traction, which may lead to the vehicle getting stuck.

## Locking Differentials

Cybertruck is equipped with locking differentials for increased traction during certain low traction and off-road conditions.

Locking differentials lock both wheels of an axle together, which forces the wheels to rotate at the same speed. This distributes the torque across the same axle based on the available traction in each wheel. When one of the locked wheels has significantly reduced traction (on sand, ice, etc.) more torque is applied to the wheel with greater traction. This distribution of torque helps the vehicle continue moving in low traction environments.

Dual Motor Variants: are equipped with mechanical front and rear locking differentials.

Tri-Motor (Cyberbeast) Variants: are equipped with a mechanical front locking differential, and a virtual rear locking differential to provide sufficient torque in each rear wheel. The rear locking differential automatically engages in certain drive modes and speeds, and cannot be manually engaged or disengaged.

CAUTION: Loading Cybertruck to the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) and engaging the locking differentials may result in damage to the drivetrain (see Vehicle Loading on page 218).

WARNING: Do not expect the locking differentials to provide sufficient traction if the vehicle does not have appropriate tires for the conditions, or Cybertruck is in a situation where all four wheels are spinning.

## Engaging Locking Differentials On Road

WARNING: Your vehicle's turning radius increases when locking differentials are engaged. It is your responsibility to be aware of your surroundings and drive carefully.

Engaging locking differentials while driving on roads is intended for specific situations where you temporarily need extra grip on loose or uneven terrain, such as getting un-stuck from a snow bank. Do not engage locking differentials unless it is needed for the road conditions. Navigate to Controls > Dynamics > Engage Rear Locking Differential. When enabled, Slippery Surface also enables (see Slippery Surfaces on page 91). Engage Rear Locking Differential should not be used for regular driving on slick surfaces.

When you engage locking differentials while driving on roads, your speed is limited to 35 mph (56 km/h). The stability control icon may appear momentarily while the locking differentials disengage (see Vehicle Status on page 14).

NOTE: This option is not available on Tri-Motor (Cyberbeast) vehicles.

## Engaging Locking Differentials Off Road

Before you engage locking differentials, consider your driving situation (such as the terrain, weather, etc.). The rear locking differentials are ideal for off-roading uphill or on level surfaces. Front locking differentials are typically used when you need more traction at the front of the vehicle, like rock crawling. To engage:

1. Access the Off-Road app.
2. Select the locking differentials you want to enable.
   For dual motor variants:
   - All On
   - Rear Only

Orange: Locking differential is engaged. This icon may blink orange while the locking differential is engaging or disengaging.

Orange question mark (?): Unknown locker position.

Red exclamation point (!): System fault or locking differential unavailable (see Troubleshooting on page 106).

You may need to drive a short distance to engage or disengage once enabled.

Once the locking differentials are fully engaged, the vehicle may slightly rock side to side when turning at low speeds. This is normal behavior when the touchscreen indicates a fully engaged locker (solid orange icon).

The locking differentials may cancel or delay engaging in various cases. If the locking differentials are unable to engage, a chime sounds and a message displays on the touchscreen. See Troubleshooting on page 106 for more information.

⚠️ WARNING: Driving with locked differentials may reduce vehicle responsiveness to steering. Always monitor your vehicle's behavior and the surroundings. Failure to do so may result in damage or serious injury.

## Disengaging Locking Differentials

To disengage, touch the differential icon on the touchscreen and select Off. You may need to drive a short distance to disengage. The locking differentials also automatically attempt to disengage whenever the vehicle shifts out of Drive, or when a different drive mode is selected.

When you disengage the locking differentials, the icon may blink orange before disappearing from the touchscreen. Ensure the locking differentials are disengaged before you drive on paved roads or at speeds higher than 35 mph (56 km/h). Check the vehicle wheels are not skipping when turning.

               Troubleshooting
Off-Road Troubleshooting
You may need to increase traction while off-roading (such as
for getting unstuck or overcoming an obstacle). Follow these
general guidelines to provide more traction to Cybertruck:



1. Engage Overland (see Overland on page 102 for more
    information).
2. Adjust the suspension height. Raise the suspension until
    the vehicle is no longer obstructed. Avoid lowering the
    suspension to prevent damage (see Suspension on page
    92).
3. Customize Terrain based on the current surface
    conditions. For high traction terrains, select Rock. For
    looser terrains, select Sand.
4. Engage the front and/or rear locking differentials (see
    Locking Differentials on page 105).
5. For softer terrain or steep inclines, engage Trail Assist for
    a steady progression through complex terrain (see Trail
    Assist on page 104).



If you still need more traction, perform the following:



1. Decrease tire pressure to 36 PSI. This increases tire
    contact with the surface, which can help provide more
    traction.
            CAUTION: The TPMS warning thresholds may be
            lowered to accommodate different off-road needs.
            Do not rely solely on the TPMS warning indicator
            when in an Off-Road mode or setting, as these
            thresholds do not comply with Federal TPMS
            standards. It is your responsibility to ensure tires
            are adequately inflated at all times and are inflated
            back to normal levels before regular driving on
            roads.



2. Use traction aids, such as traction boards.
3. Tow your vehicle. See Instructions for Transporters on
    page 228 for more information on towing Cybertruck.

# Limitations and Warnings

Off-road driving depends on the performance of the air suspension system, brakes, power steering, and other vehicle systems. If there is a condition affecting the performance of any dependent system, a message displays on the touchscreen and off-road driving modes are unavailable.

⚠️ **WARNING:** Before driving off road, carefully survey the terrain and be aware of the weather forecast and other environmental conditions. Exercise extreme caution when approaching steep ascents and descents. While driving off road, always be aware of your surroundings and survey the terrain as necessary. Tesla is not liable for any damage to Cybertruck resulting from off-road driving.

⚠️ **WARNING:** Never depend on the driving visualization to show you obstacles in front of, behind, or to the sides of Cybertruck. Always use caution while driving off road and perform visual checks when necessary. The visualization relies on the cameras mounted on Cybertruck (see Cameras on page 27). External factors (such as a dirty or obscured lens) may affect the performance of a camera, and the cameras may not detect objects or barriers that can potentially cause damage or injury.

⚠️ **WARNING:** Visibility may be limited by sharp crests and uneven terrain. Always check what is at the top of a hill and over the crest before driving over it, and be aware of steep descents or other obstacles.

⚠️ **WARNING:** Before approaching an obstacle, ensure that Cybertruck has enough ground clearance to clear it. If the bottom of Cybertruck is contacting the ground even with the ride height at the highest setting, reduce your speed or avoid the obstacle altogether.

⚠️ **WARNING:** Exercise extra caution when the terrain surface is wet, sandy, or slippery. Loose gravel, sand, and other environmental conditions may affect the performance of Off-Road Modes.

⚠️ **WARNING:** Before driving off road, make sure that loose items in the cabin are stowed or secured and ensure that the cargo bed is free of cargo, or that cargo is tightly secured.

# Towing a Trailer

NOTE: You cannot enable Off-Road Modes and Trailer Mode at the same time.

NOTE: If the towing capacity on the hitch label conflicts with the information provided in this owner's manual, this owner's manual takes precedence.

## Towing Guidelines

Towing a trailer puts additional load on the motors, drive train, brakes, tires, and suspension and significantly decreases range. If you tow a trailer, follow these general guidelines:

- Reduce your driving speed and avoid sudden maneuvers. Keep in mind that when towing a trailer, steering, stability, turning radius, stopping distances, and braking performance are different when compared to driving without a trailer.

- Increase your following distance by maintaining at least twice the typical distance from the vehicle ahead. This helps avoid situations that require heavy braking. Sudden braking may result in skidding or jack-knifing, and loss of control.

- Avoid sharp turns. Sharp turns can cause the trailer to contact Cybertruck and cause damage. Make wider turns to prevent the trailer from hitting curbs, road signs, trees, or other objects.

- Periodically check the trailer lights and turn signals to confirm that bulbs are still working (see Trailer Light Test on page 112). When towing a trailer, the turn signal arrows on the touchscreen flash as normal, even if the bulbs on the trailer are burnt out.

- Periodically confirm the cargo is secure.

- Periodically confirm the trailer brakes are working (see Trailer Brakes on page 112).

- Avoid parking on a grade (see Parking with a Trailer on page 113).

- Regularly confirm that all towing components are secured.

## Before Towing a Trailer

Before towing a trailer, you must do the following:

1. Review all regulations and legal requirements in your state/region that apply to towing a trailer. Failure to comply with regulations can compromise your safety.

2. Inflate tires to the cold tire inflation pressure specified in Tire Pressures when Towing on page 111.

3. Set the suspension height to match the trailer height. Tesla recommends Low (Controls > Suspension > Low). You must choose a ball mount suitable for your towing needs. See Ball Mount Specifications on page 114 for more information.

4. Adjust all mirrors to provide a clear rearward view without a significant blind spot.

NOTE: Use towing mirrors for larger trailers.

5. Confirm the trailer load is evenly distributed such that the trailer tongue weight is approximately 10% of the total trailer weight, without exceeding the maximum tongue weights provided in Towing Capacity on page 110.

6. Engage Trailer Mode (see Trailer Mode on page 111).

7. Calibrate the trailer brakes (see Trailer Brakes on page 112).

Then, confirm the following:

1. Cybertruck rests horizontally with the trailer attached. If the vehicle is tipped up at the front, and down at the rear, check that you are not exceeding the maximum towing capacity and tongue weights provided in Towing Capacity on page 110.

2. All trailer hitch parts and attachments, safety chains, and electrical connectors are in good condition and properly connected. If any problems are apparent, do not tow the trailer.

3. Trailer lights (brake lights, turn signal lights, marker lights, etc.) are working properly.

4. The trailer tongue is securely connected to the hitch ball.

5. Safety chains are properly connected between the trailer and the vehicle. Cross the safety chains under the tongue of the trailer to help prevent the tongue from contacting the road if it separates from the hitch. Leave enough slack in the safety chains to allow for turns and ensure that the chains can never drag on the ground.

6. Wheel chocks are available and easy to access.

7. All cargo is secured.

NOTE: For general information about trailer safety provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, go to https://one.nhtsa.gov/cars/problems/equipment/towing/index.htm.

WARNING: The trailer tongue weight must be approximately 10% of the total trailer weight without exceeding the maximum tongue weights provided in Towing Capacity on page 110. Loads that are balanced over the wheels or heavier in the rear can cause trailer sway, resulting in loss of vehicle control.

WARNING: Always ensure that cargo is secured in the trailer and will not shift. Dynamic load shifts can cause loss of vehicle control, resulting in serious injury or death.

## Towing Capacity

The total trailer weight (including all cargo and additional equipment), and the trailer tongue weight, must never exceed the following:

| Wheel Size | Maximum Towing Capacity | Maximum Tongue Weight* |
|------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| 20" x 9J   | 11,000 lb (4,990 kg)     | 1,100 lb (499 kg)      |
---
# Towing a Trailer

*The tongue weight is the downward force that the weight of the trailer exerts on the hitch. It must not exceed 10% of the maximum towing capacity. Carrying a significant amount of equipment, passengers, or cargo in the tow vehicle can reduce the tongue weight it can handle, which also reduces the maximum towing capacity. Maximum towing capacity is calculated assuming the GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating) is not exceeded. For GVWR, see Vehicle Loading on page 218).*

⚠️ CAUTION: Tesla assumes no responsibility for damage or injuries resulting from towing a trailer, for any errors or omissions in the instructions accompanying towing equipment, or for your failure to follow the proper instructions. Damage caused by towing a trailer is not covered by the warranty.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not overload the vehicle or trailer. Doing so can cause poor performance, vehicle damage and loss of vehicle control, resulting in serious injury.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not use the trailer hitch to tow/transport Cybertruck.

⚠️ WARNING: Never operate a trailer with a negative tongue weight, where the trailer tongue pulls upward on the trailer hitch. Negative tongue weights can significantly increase the risk of trailer sway or loss of stability.

## Tire Pressures when Towing

When towing a trailer, tire pressures must be adjusted to accommodate the additional load. Keep tires inflated to the pressures shown below (these pressures override the pressures that are provided on the Tire and Loading information label – see Vehicle Loading on page 218):

| Tires | Cold Tire Inflation Pressure |
|-------|------------------------------|
| 20" All Season | 50 psi |
| 20" All Terrain | 65 psi |

⚠️ WARNING: Check tire pressures using an accurate pressure gauge when tires are cold (see Tire Pressures on page 195). Driving one mile (1.6 km) warms the tires sufficiently to affect tire pressures. Parking the vehicle in direct sunlight or in hot weather can also affect tire pressures. If you must check warm tires, expect increased pressures. Do not let air out of warm tires in an attempt to match recommended cold tire pressures. A hot tire at or below the recommended cold tire inflation pressure is dangerously under-inflated.

⚠️ WARNING: Never attempt to tow a trailer when a tire is faulty or has been inflated using a tire repair kit. A temporarily repaired tire is not designed to sustain the towing load. Towing using a faulty or temporarily repaired tire can result in tire failure and loss of vehicle stability.

## Trailer Mode

Trailer Mode must always be active when towing a trailer. When you connect a trailer's electrical connection (see Electrical Connections on page 114), Cybertruck automatically engages Trailer Mode. Trailer Mode disengages when you disconnect the trailer's electrical connection. To engage or exit Trailer Mode manually, touch Controls > Towing & Hauling > Trailer Mode on the touchscreen. One of the following indicators displays on the touchscreen:

🚛 Trailer Mode is active.

🚛 Cybertruck detects a connection for trailer lights but Trailer Mode is disabled. It is likely that a carrying accessory has been connected.

🚛 Cybertruck detects a faulty electrical connection for the trailer lights. Some, or all, trailer lights may not be functioning. Pull over as soon as safety permits and inspect the trailer lights for faulty cabling or connections. If the issue is resolved and the red icon persists, manually turn Trailer Mode off and on again.

Some Autopilot features, and any feature that requires the use of the rear camera, may be unavailable when Trailer Mode is enabled. In addition, some features may operate differently. For example:

- Autosteer (if equipped) is unavailable. Therefore, for Traffic-Aware Cruise Control availability, touch Controls > Autopilot > Autopilot Activation > Double Click. This allows you to engage Traffic-Aware Cruise Control with a single click of the right scroll button on the steering wheel.

- Traffic-Aware Cruise Control increases the following distance from the car in front of you.

- The air suspension system will not make speed-based adjustments from Medium to Low and does not automatically raise ride height based on saved locations.

- Side collision warnings are active but automatic steering interventions are disabled.

- The braking force provided by Automatic Emergency Braking (see Collision Avoidance Assist on page 144) is significantly limited.

NOTE: Trailer brakes are only available when Trailer Mode is engaged.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not rely on Cybertruck to automatically detect a trailer in all cases. Always check that Trailer Mode is engaged before towing a trailer.
---
# Towing a Trailer

WARNING: Remaining in Trailer Mode will help ensure Cybertruck remains stable in adverse conditions while towing. Do not exit Trailer Mode while towing a trailer. Exiting Trailer Mode could result in loss of vehicle stability.

## Trailer Alarm

When enabled, Cybertruck sounds an alarm if the vehicle detects the trailer is being unplugged while Trailer Mode is active and the vehicle is locked.

## Trailer Brakes

Cybertruck is equipped with a trailer brake controller which automatically applies the trailer brakes when you decelerate. To update your trailer brake preferences, navigate to Controls > Towing & Hauling where you can:

- Enable/disable Trailer Mode on page 111.
- Customize Trailer Brake Gain on page 112.

NOTE: Tesla recommends always enabling the trailer brakes, otherwise stopping distance may be increased. To disable the trailer brakes, first disable Trailer Mode or set the Trailer Brake Gain to 0.

- Choose how to manually apply the trailer brakes (either with the touchscreen or right scroll button). The trailer brake activation button is unaffected.
- Adjust Trailer Brake Boost on page 112.
- Toggle Adaptive Regenerative Braking on page 112.
- Perform the Trailer Light Test on page 112.

You can also set up a shortcut for Towing & Hauling by adding it to your vehicle "Cards" area, near the bottom of the touchscreen.

## Trailer Brake Gain

The Trailer Brake Gain slider is a scale between 0 and 10 that calibrates the degree of trailer braking applied when you press the brake pedal normally. 0 applies no trailer brakes, whereas 10 applies the full trailer brakes.

Set this up each time you connect a trailer to ensure your trailer brakes do not lock up:

1. Ensure the trailer is securely attached to the Cybertruck hitch assembly.
2. Drive Cybertruck in a safe, open area at low speeds (10-15mph or 15-25 km/h).
3. Use the right scroll button on the steering wheel or Trailer Brake Activation (set your preference in Towing & Hauling) to apply the trailer brakes while moving. Adjust the Trailer Brake Gain as needed to ensure the trailer brakes do not lock up when they are applied. If the wheels do lock up, decrease the amount of gain slightly and repeat this process.

The ideal Trailer Brake Gain varies depending on your trailer load, number of axles, and surface conditions. You must adjust as needed if conditions change.

## Trailer Brake Boost

Tesla recommends initially setting your Trailer Brake Boost to Low. Once Trailer Brake Gain is calibrated, adjust based on your preferences by driving around in a safe, open area and applying the brakes as you would in normal traffic. Increasing will make your brakes react more quickly, although the braking feels more harsh to passengers.

## Adaptive Regenerative Braking

At the start of every drive, Cybertruck estimates the load to determine the proper level of regenerative braking. Regenerative braking will start at the standard level and increase as the vehicle learns your trailer/cargo weight. This weight estimation works best when driving in a straight line on a flat, smooth surface.

NOTE: Adaptive regenerative braking does not engage the trailer brakes. In order to engage the trailer brakes, you must press the brake pedal or enable trailer brakes on the touchscreen.

WARNING: It is your responsibility to determine when to enable Adaptive Regenerative Braking. Always drive safely and avoid situations that could require heavy braking.

WARNING: Towing increases your stopping distance. When towing, increase your following distance and avoid situations that could potentially cause heavy braking. Failure to do so can result in a collision.

WARNING: Observe all regulations and legal requirements in your regional and national jurisdictions that apply specifically to trailer towing and brake requirements. Many regions require a breakaway switch, located on the tongue of the trailer, to activate the trailer brakes if the trailer separates from the vehicle. Failure to comply with regulations can compromise your safety.

## Trailer Light Test

Before towing, and periodically during towing, use Trailer Light Test to confirm the trailer lights are working as expected.

WARNING: Do not tow a trailer if the trailer lights or trailer brakes are not working properly.

# Towing a Trailer

## Trailer Brake Controller Limitations

WARNING: It is your responsibility to understand your towing needs, proper towing procedures, trailer brakes (such as their use and limitations), and the risks and limitations of towing. Do not tow with Cybertruck if you do not have towing knowledge and experience; doing so may result in damage, injury or death. Damage as a result of improper towing is not covered by the warranty.

Keep in mind the following brake controller limitations:

- Properly maintain and use trailer brakes as intended to prevent damage.
- The trailer brake controller and auxiliary output is 12V.
- Abusive or extensively long manual activations of the trailer brake controller may cause overheating with some trailer brake loads.
- Maximum power draw - The onboard trailer controller is designed to support most trailer power applications. The power allocations are:

| Type | Lights | Auxiliary power | Trailer brakes |
|------|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| Standard trailer brakes (when braking power is derived from brake output, e.g. non-EOH Electric Drum brakes) | Lights: Max. 220 Watts total for all light outputs combined. | Auxiliary power (AUX 12V+ Charging): Max. 270 Watts (20 Amps). | Trailer brakes: Max. 331 Watts |
| Electric over Hydraulic trailer brakes (braking power is derived from auxiliary power output, e.g. EOH, Hydraulic disk brakes, see Electric Over Hydraulic (EOH) Brakes on page 113) | Lights: Max. 220 Watts total for all light outputs combined. | Auxiliary power (AUX 12V+ Charging): Max. 405 Watts (30 Amps). | Trailer brakes: Max. 48 Watts (Current draw must be less than 3 Amps). |

Cybertruck switches to the standard brakes if a 3A or higher load on the trailer brake connections is detected.

The auxiliary output is capable of supplying up to 30 Amps when supporting an EOH trailer brake unit. You are responsible for understanding the power needs of your EOH trailer brake unit. Using an EOH trailer brake controller that draws more than 30 Amps may result in a loss of power to the trailer brakes while braking.

The usage of only an EOH unit with the auxiliary power port is supported for maximum braking availability. A battery in parallel is recommended. The battery must be in good health and is expected to already be present in most states per DOT regulations.

CAUTION: Tesla does not recommend using EOH trailer brakes simultaneously with other auxiliary power loads. Doing so could lead to complications or loss of power to the EOH trailer brakes unit.

## Parking with a Trailer

Whenever possible, avoid parking on a grade. However, if parking on a grade is absolutely necessary, place wheel chocks under the trailer wheels:

1. One person presses and holds the brake pedal.
2. A second person places the wheel chocks under the wheels on the downgrade side of the trailer's tires.
3. When the chocks are in place, slowly release the brake pedal and ensure the chocks hold the weight of the vehicle and trailer.

   NOTE: When testing chocks, ensure that Vehicle Hold (see Vehicle Hold on page 88) is engaged. If Vehicle Hold is braking Cybertruck, the associated indicator light appears on the touchscreen. To disengage Vehicle Hold, press and release the brake pedal.

4. Place the vehicle in Park.

WARNING: If parking on a grade is necessary, ensure that all trailer wheels have been securely chocked. Failure to do so can result in serious damage, injury, or death.

## Electric Over Hydraulic (EOH) Brakes

Cybertruck supports standard electric brakes and Electric over Hydraulic (EOH) brakes. If using EOH brakes, Tesla recommends connecting a battery in parallel with the auxiliary power output to the EOH unit.
---
# Towing a Trailer

## Trailer Sway Mitigation

When trailer sway is detected, your vehicle's electronic stability control system attempts to apply the appropriate amount of braking to minimize trailer sway. The touchscreen briefly displays the traction control system indicator. Manually applying the brakes (via right scroll button on the steering wheel or the Trailer Brake setting) when the system is actively braking to mitigate trailer sway does not cancel this automatic braking. However, it is still your responsibility to drive carefully and brake when needed, taking into consideration possible trailer sway.

NOTE: The maximum permissible rear overhang for the coupling point is 49 in (1.25 m), measuring from the center of the rear tire toward the hitch receiver.

NOTE: Always attach safety chains when towing. See your trailer Owner's Manual for more information.

## Ball Mount Specifications

A ball mount must be purchased separately based on your towing needs. The Cybertruck hitch receiver supports a 2 in (5 cm) ball mount. Follow the ball mount manufacturer's instructions for more information.

## Accessing the Trailer Hitch Assembly

The Cybertruck trailer hitch assembly is located behind the rear fascia of the vehicle, under the tailgate. Your vehicle is not equipped with a ball mount, which must be purchased separately based on your towing needs.

[Image showing the rear of a Cybertruck with the trailer hitch assembly and ball mount]

NOTE: Refer to the manufacturer's instructions to properly maintain the ball mount.

## Electrical Connections

The trailer hitch cover is attached to the body of the vehicle with three turn clips. Use a flat trim tool or non-marring screwdriver to partially turn and unlock the clips, then remove the trailer hitch cover and place it in a secure, dry place. Once removed, you can see where the ball mount can be installed.

[Image showing the trailer hitch cover and electrical connections]

Cybertruck is equipped with a combination electrical outlet, located near the hitch assembly, that supports two types of commonly-used trailer plugs without needing an adapter:

- 7-PIN - SAE J2863 - for heavier trailer loads requiring their own braking system.
- 4-PIN - SAE J1239 - for light trailer loads requiring lights only.

Regulations require that all trailers, at a minimum, are equipped with taillights and turn signals. These are provided on the 4-pin connector, which is adequate when pulling a light load. For heavier loads, the trailer must also be equipped with brakes, available on the 7-pin connector.

Plugging a trailer's wiring into either electrical outlet automatically engages Trailer Mode (see Trailer Mode on page 111).

NOTE: Use one outlet only according to your trailering needs. The covers prevent you from opening both outlets simultaneously.

When not actively towing, keep the cover installed to prevent dirt and debris from entering.

### 7-PIN Connector

# Towing a Trailer

⚠️ WARNING: Before towing, it is the driver's responsibility to ensure that all electrical connections are working, all trailer lights are operating as expected, and the braking system is fully functioning. Cybertruck does not detect faulty electrical connections. You must perform manual checks. Failure to do so can result in property damage, personal injury, or death.

⚠️ WARNING: Use only the electrical connection designed by Tesla. Do not attempt to directly splice or attempt to connect trailer electrical wiring using any other method. Doing so can damage the vehicle electrical system and cause malfunctions.

## Impact on Range

Towing a trailer and carrying accessories increases vehicle weight and drag. As a result, driving range can decrease significantly. Although Trip Planner attempts to adjust estimates based on Trailer Mode, actual energy consumption may vary. Plan trip length and charging destinations accordingly.

| Pin | Function |
|-----|----------|
| 1. | Left Turn/Stop Light (Yellow) |
| 2. | "-" Ground (White) |
| 3. | Trailer Brake Output (Blue) |
| 4. | Right Turn/Stop Light (Green) |
| 5. | +12V Auxiliary Power (Orange) |
| 6. | Running (or Side Marker) Lights (Brown) |
| 7. | Reverse Lights (Gray) |

| 1. | Ground (White) |
| 2. | Tail and License Plate lights (Brown) |
| 3. | Left Turn/Stop Light (Yellow) |
| 4. | Right Turn/Stop Light (Green) |

Loss of trailer lights when towing may be the result of a fault in the trailer wiring or excessive power consumption by the lights connected to the trailer output(s). When this occurs, the touchscreen displays a red Trailer Mode icon. Fix any issues with the wiring and/or reduce the number of lights connected to the trailer output(s), then turn Trailer Mode off and on to try again.

⚠️ CAUTION: Always ensure that the trailer's electrical cable does not contact or drag on the ground and there is enough slack in the cable to allow for turns.

# Carrying Accessories and Crossbars

⚠️ WARNING: Tesla assumes no responsibility for damage
or injuries resulting from installing and using a carrier
or crossbars, for any omissions in the instructions
accompanying a carrier or crossbar, or for your failure
to follow the instructions. Damage caused by using a
carrier or crossbars is not covered by the warranty.

## Carrying Accessories

The load that the hitch receiver can support varies based on
the configuration of the accessory carrier. The maximum
tongue weight—the downward force on the trailer hitch—of
Cybertruck is 1,100 lbs (500 kg). The maximum weight
decreases when the center of gravity (the effective center
point of the load) of the accessory carrier is farther from the
trailer hitch. Refer to the table below for common examples.

| Accessory | Center of Mass Distance from Hitch Pin | Maximum Load |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|--------------|
|           | Horizontal Distance | Vertical Distance |              |
| 4-Bicycle carrier | 32.2 in. 817 mm | 29.9 in. 760 mm | 220 lb 100 kg |
| Motorcycle carrier | 17.8 in. 453 mm | 25.8 in. 655 mm | 375 lb 170 kg |
| Trailer ball | 7.3 in. 185 mm | 1.2 in. 30 mm | 1,100 lb 500 kg |

Examples of type of carrier and general distance from the
hitch pin:

1. Trailer (heaviest)
2. Motorbike carrier (lighter)
3. Four bike carrier (lightest)

Follow the instructions provided with your accessory carrier
to install onto Cybertruck. Observe all regulations and legal
requirements in your state/region that apply to carrying
accessories.

Heavier items should be mounted more closely to the hitch
pin. When using a carrier mounted to the trailer hitch to carry
bicycles, skis, or other items, always check to ensure that the
maximum weight is not exceeded. The maximum weight
includes the weight of the accessories plus the weight of the
carrier itself.

Cybertruck includes the wiring necessary for using an
accessory carrier equipped with lights (see Electrical
Connections on page 114). Cybertruck also includes Trailer
Mode software (see Trailer Mode on page 111).

⚠️ CAUTION: An accessory carrier attached to the rear of
Cybertruck may obscure your view from the rear view
mirror and the rear camera.

🚐 When you connect an accessory carrier's
wiring harness, Cybertruck detects a
connection for trailer lights and displays this
indicator on the touchscreen to indicate that
Trailer Mode is disabled.

When carrying accessories, periodically confirm that the
accessory carrier and its cargo remain secure at all times,
and if applicable, that the lights on the accessory carrier are
working.

## Installing Brackets onto the Appliques

1. Open all 8 applique doors.

# Carrying Accessories and Crossbars

## Installing Crossbars

NOTE: Installing the crossbars requires two people.

⚠️ CAUTION: Crossbars must be installed in tandem. Failure to do so may cause damage.

⚠️ CAUTION: It is your responsibility to ensure your accessories are secured to the crossbars. Periodically check to ensure your accessories have not moved or loosened throughout your driving. See the in-box instructions that come with the crossbars for more information.

⚠️ CAUTION: If installing a crossbar on the front-most applique doors, make sure that the power feed harness on the passenger side applique is not pinched during installation. If necessary, use a trim tool to release the applique and maneuver the harness away from the studs.

2. Use the provided torque wrench to loosen and remove the nuts that are fastened to the threaded studs located within the applique doors.

3. Install a bracket by positioning the bracket so that the raised arrow on it is directed outward, away from the vehicle. Align it with the threaded studs and set it in place.

4. Use the nuts that were removed in step 2 and tighten them back onto the threaded studs with the provided torque wrench.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the remaining applique doors.

NOTE: After installing the brackets once, you can leave them installed for future use, unless you want to move the crossbars to different locations on the vehicle.

NOTE: If a roof applique is not secured correctly, the applique could fall off of the vehicle. Tesla is not responsible for broken or missing appliques.

To install the crossbars:

1. Locate the FRONT arrow embossed on the bottom of the crossbar. The arrow should point toward the front of the vehicle.

2. Lower one tower (edge of the crossbar) onto the bracket and extend the crossbar so that the other tower aligns with the bracket on the opposite side.

3. Use the key to open the tower doors. Push down to seat both towers.

Towing 117

# Carrying Accessories and Crossbars

4. Once the towers are completely seated, close the tower doors securely using the key. You will hear and feel a "click" when the tower door is closed completely. If there is resistance to closing or if the door physically cannot be closed, the tower door is not seated properly. Turn the key to open the door, re-position, and use the key to close to door again.

5. Repeat this on the other side of the crossbar.

6. Repeat steps 1-5 to install your second crossbar directly in front of or behind the first one.

7. To test the secure installation of the crossbars, push and pull them in all directions. If any movement is observed at any of the four towers, re-seat the affected crossbars, then retest the installation.

NOTE: Keep the key in a dry, safe area for future use.

## Weight limits

The crossbars are capable of supporting up to 220 lbs per crossbar set. See the in-box instructions that come with the crossbars for more information.

# About Autopilot

Autopilot is a suite of advanced driver assistance features that are intended to make driving safer and less stressful. None of these features make Cybertruck fully autonomous or replace you as the driver. Autopilot features come standard with all new Tesla vehicles.

NOTE: Depending on date of manufacture, software version, and vehicle configuration, your vehicle may not be equipped with the following features, or a feature may not operate exactly as described.

Basic Autopilot includes Traffic-Aware Cruise Control.

- Traffic-Aware Cruise Control: Maintains your speed and an adjustable following distance from the vehicle in front of you, if there is one (see Traffic-Aware Cruise Control on page 121).

WARNING: Autopilot is designed for your driving comfort and convenience and is not a collision warning or avoidance system. It is your responsibility to stay alert, drive safely, and be in control of the vehicle at all times. Never depend on Autopilot to adequately slow down Cybertruck. Always watch the road in front of you and be prepared to take corrective action at all times. Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death.

It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the limitations of Autopilot and be ready to take control at all times. For more limitations, cautions, and warnings, see Limitations and Warnings on page 138.

WARNING: Basic Autopilot is a hands-on feature. Keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times and be mindful of road conditions, surrounding traffic, and other road users (such as pedestrians and cyclists). Always be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury, or death.

Full Self-Driving includes additional features that are designed to further reduce driver workload and make common actions, such as changing lanes or parking, easier.

- Traffic Light & Stop Sign Control: Maintains your speed, keeps a following distance, and keeps Cybertruck in its lane while also slowing down and stopping for traffic lights and stop signs (see Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control on page 125).

- Full Self-Driving (Supervised): Attempts to drive to your destination by following curves in the road; stopping at and negotiating intersections, stop signs, and roundabouts; making left and right turns; and entering/ exiting highways (see Full Self-Driving (Supervised) on page 134).

- Autopark: Parks Cybertruck, either parallel or perpendicularly (see Autopark on page 132).

## How It Works

Autopilot uses the cameras on Cybertruck, which monitor the surrounding area and detect other vehicles, pedestrians, road markings, and obstacles such as barriers and curbs. There are cameras mounted on the front, rear, left, and right sides of Cybertruck (see Cameras on page 27).

When Autopilot is engaged, Cybertruck shows a series of escalating warnings reminding you to keep your hands on the wheel and pay attention to the road. If there is no response, Autopilot disengages and is unavailable for the remainder of the drive.

# About Autopilot

## Autopilot Conditions

Ensure all cameras are clean and free of obstructions before each drive and before using Autopilot features (see Cleaning a Camera on page 28). Dirty cameras as well as environmental conditions such as rain and faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance. If a camera is obstructed or blinded, Cybertruck displays a message on the touchscreen and Autopilot features may not be available. For more information on specific alerts, see Troubleshooting Alerts on page 242.

Before you can use Autopilot features, and after some Service visits, you must drive a short distance to calibrate cameras. For more information, see Drive to Calibrate Cameras on page 29.

In addition, these features may not work as intended when:

- The road has sharp curves or significant changes in elevation.
- Road signs and signals are unclear, ambiguous, or poorly maintained.
- Visibility is poor (due to heavy rain, snow, hail, etc. or poorly lit roadways at night)
- You are driving in a tunnel or next to a highway divider that interferes with the view of the camera(s)
- Bright light (such as from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight) interferes with the view of the camera(s).

The list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of Autopilot features. For more information, see Limitations and Warnings on page 138.

NOTE: Depending on date of manufacture, software version, and vehicle configuration, your vehicle may not be equipped with the following features, or a feature may not operate exactly as described.

| Autopilot Feature | Available When |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Traffic-Aware Cruise Control | - You are driving between 18 mph (30 km/h) and 85 mph (140 km/h)<br>NOTE: You can activate Traffic-Aware Cruise Control at lower speeds if there is a vehicle detected at least 5 feet (1.5 meters) ahead of Cybertruck. |
| Full Self-Driving (Supervised) | - You are driving less than 85 mph (150 km/h).<br>NOTE: You can activate Full Self-Driving (Supervised) at lower speeds, including when Cybertruck is at a standstill, whether or not there is a vehicle detected in front of Cybertruck.<br><br>- Headlights are set to On or Auto. Although Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is available both during the day and in low light conditions (dusk or dark), it aborts or is unavailable if headlights are set to Off. When Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is engaged, Auto High Beam is automatically enabled (see Headlights on page 82) and the wiper is set to Auto. |

# Autopilot Features

This topic describes how to enable and use the following driver assistance features.

NOTE: Depending on date of manufacture, software version, and vehicle configuration, your vehicle may not be equipped with the following features, or a feature may not operate exactly as described.

- Traffic-Aware Cruise Control: Like traditional cruise control, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control maintains a set driving speed. However, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control also slows down or accelerates Cybertruck as needed to maintain the following distance from the vehicle in front of you. While Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is engaged, you are still responsible for steering Cybertruck (see Traffic-Aware Cruise Control on page 121).

These features use information from the cameras on Cybertruck to detect lane markings, road edges, and other vehicles and road users around Cybertruck.

⚠️ CAUTION: Ensure all cameras are clean and free of obstructions before each drive and before using Autopilot features (see Cleaning a Camera on page 28). Dirty cameras as well as environmental conditions such as rain and faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance. If a camera is obstructed or blinded, Cybertruck displays a message on the touchscreen and Autopilot features may not be available. For more information on specific alerts, see Troubleshooting Alerts on page 242.

⚠️ CAUTION: It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the limitations of Autopilot and the situations in which driver intervention may be needed. For more information, see Limitations and Warnings on page 138.

## Autopilot Settings

Before you use Autopilot features, customize how they work by touching Controls > Autopilot.

- Set Speed: Choose whether Autopilot engages at the currently detected speed limit or your current driving speed. Touch Controls > Autopilot > Set Speed and choose either Speed Limit or Current Speed.

- Offset: If you choose Speed Limit, you can specify an offset by touching Set Speed Offset. You can choose Fixed (the cruising speed adjusts by a specific amount on all roads) or Percentage (the cruising speed is adjusted as a percentage of the road's detected speed limit).

- Green Traffic Light Chime: In Canada and U.S.: If on, a chime will sound when you are waiting at a red traffic light and the light turns green. If you are not actively using Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and are waiting at a red light with a car in front of you, the chime sounds when the car ahead of you advances.

## Traffic-Aware Cruise Control

Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is always enabled.

To use Traffic-Aware Cruise Control:

1. Press the right scroll button, then release the accelerator pedal to allow Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to maintain the cruising speed. A chime sounds to indicate that Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is now active.

2. To change the set speed, roll the right scroll wheel up to increase, or down to decrease. You can apply the accelerator at any time to temporarily override the set cruising speed. For more information, see While Using Autopilot on page 122.

3. To cancel Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, press the right scroll button or press the brake pedal. For more information, see Canceling Autopilot on page 121.

| 40 MAX | When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is available but not engaged, the touchscreen displays the cruising speed in gray. The number shown represents the speed that will be set when you engage Traffic-Aware Cruise Control. |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 40 MAX | When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is actively cruising at a set speed, the speed is highlighted with blue text. |

⚠️ WARNING: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is designed for your driving comfort and convenience and is not a collision warning or avoidance system. It is your responsibility to stay alert, drive safely, and be in control of the vehicle at all times. Never depend on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to adequately slow down Cybertruck. Always watch the road in front of you and be prepared to take corrective action at all times. Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death. For more information, see Limitations and Warnings on page 138.

## Canceling Autopilot

Traffic-Aware Cruise Control cancels when:

- You press the right scroll button on the steering wheel.
- You press the brake pedal.
- You exceed 90 mph (150 km/h).
- You shift into Reverse, Park, or Neutral.
- A door is opened.
- An Automatic Emergency Braking event occurs (see Collision Avoidance Assist on page 144).
- The driver's seatbelt is released, and/or the driver gets out of their seat.

When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control cancels, the cruising speed icon on the touchscreen turns gray to indicate that Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is no longer active.
---
# Autopilot Features

When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control cancels, Cybertruck does not coast. Instead, regenerative braking slows down Cybertruck in the same way as when you move your foot off the accelerator when driving without Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (see Regenerative Braking on page ).

## While Using Autopilot

When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is active and Autopilot is maintaining a set speed, the speed is highlighted with blue text on the touchscreen.

### Maintaining the Set Speed

When Autopilot is active, Cybertruck maintains your set cruising speed whenever a vehicle is not detected in front of it. When cruising behind a vehicle, Cybertruck accelerates and decelerates as needed to maintain a chosen following distance (see Adjusting the Following Distance on page 122), up to the set speed.

You can manually accelerate at any time by pressing the accelerator pedal, but when you release the pedal Cybertruck resumes cruising at the set speed.

Cybertruck also adjusts the cruising speed when entering and exiting curves.

When Cybertruck is actively slowing down to maintain the selected distance from the vehicle ahead, brake lights turn on. You may notice slight movement of the brake pedal. However, when Cybertruck is accelerating, the accelerator pedal does not move.

It may take a few seconds for Cybertruck to reach the new cruising speed.

### Changing the Set Speed

Roll the right scroll wheel up to increase, or down to decrease, the set speed.

### Adjusting the Following Distance

To adjust the following distance you want to maintain between Cybertruck and a vehicle traveling ahead of you, touch Controls > Autopilot > Cruise Follow Distance or press the right scroll button on the steering wheel to the left or right.

[An image of a steering wheel control is shown, with up and down arrows indicating the scroll wheel functionality for adjusting speed]

# Autopilot Features

Steering wheel with Autopilot controls and vehicle following illustration

When following a vehicle, Autopilot remains active at low speeds, even when Cybertruck comes to a full stop. For example, Autopilot remains active even if Cybertruck slows down to a complete or near-complete stop in heavy, stop-and-go traffic on a highway. When traffic starts moving more rapidly, Autopilot again accelerates up to the set speed.

Sometimes when Cybertruck is at a full stop, Autopilot goes into a HOLD state. If this happens, briefly press the accelerator pedal to resume cruising.

The closest following distance is 2.

Each setting corresponds to a time-based distance that represents how long it takes for Cybertruck, from its current location, to reach the location of the rear bumper of the vehicle ahead of you. Autopilot retains your setting until you change it again.

As you adjust the following distance, the touchscreen displays the current setting.

When the HOLD status is active, the touchscreen displays the HOLD icon and a message that indicates that you need to resume cruise control.

Cybertruck goes into HOLD state while Autopilot is active in the following circumstances:

- Cybertruck has been at a standstill for 5 minutes.
- Cybertruck detects a pedestrian (the HOLD state may clear when the pedestrian is no longer detected).
- Cybertruck suddenly loses visibility of the vehicle in front of you.
- An obstacle is detected in front of Cybertruck.

## Stopping and Slowdowns

When moving significantly faster than vehicles in adjacent lanes, Cybertruck automatically reduces the driving speed. This is especially helpful in heavy traffic situations or when vehicles are constantly merging into different lanes. When Cybertruck detects other vehicles driving significantly slower, the touchscreen highlights the adjacent lanes with arrows and detected vehicles in gray, and Cybertruck reduces the driving speed as appropriate. To temporarily override this feature, press the accelerator pedal.

## Cruising Near or On Exits

When you are cruising near an exit on a controlled-access highway and engage the turn signal toward the off-ramp, Autopilot assumes you are exiting and begins to slow down Cybertruck. If you do not drive onto the off-ramp, Autopilot resumes cruising at the set speed.

In a region with right hand traffic, this occurs only when you engage the right turn signal when driving in the right-most lane within 164 ft. (50 meters) of an exit. Likewise in regions with left hand traffic, this occurs when engaging the left turn signal when driving in the left-most lane within 164 ft. (50 meters) of an exit.

Autopilot 123

# Autopilot Features

When enabled while on a highway interchange or off-ramp, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may reduce your set speed in 5 mph (5 km/h) increments – to as slow as 25 mph (40 km/h) – to better match the reported speeds of other Tesla vehicles that have driven at that specific location. To override this and continue cruising at your set speed, tap the accelerator pedal. The new set speed is maintained for the duration of the interchange or off-ramp (unless you override it or cancel Autopilot). After the interchange or off-ramp, the set speed may revert or change as necessary based on the new location. For example, if you merged onto a different highway, the set cruising speed reverts to what it was before driving on the interchange.

⚠️ WARNING: In some cases (such as having insufficient data), Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may not automatically reduce the set speed on the highway interchange or off-ramp. Do not rely on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to determine an appropriate driving speed. Tesla recommends driving at a speed that is safe for road conditions and within posted speed limits.

When cruising onto an on-ramp to a controlled-access highway, Autopilot automatically adjusts the set cruising speed to the speed limit of the highway, plus any offset you have specified.

## Overtake Acceleration

Engage the turn signal momentarily to accelerate Cybertruck towards the vehicle ahead of it. By momentarily holding the turn signal, you can quickly accelerate up to your set speed without having to press the accelerator pedal as long as:

- Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is operating and detects a vehicle in front of you.
- No obstacles or vehicles are detected in the target lane.
- Cybertruck is traveling below the set speed, but over 45 mph (72 km/h).

Cybertruck stops accelerating when you reach your set cruising speed, if changing lanes takes too long, or if Cybertruck gets too close the vehicle ahead. Cybertruck also stops accelerating if you disengage the turn signal.

## Stop Light and Stop Sign Warning

While Autopilot is in use, Cybertruck displays a warning on the touchscreen and sounds a chime if it detects that you are likely to run through a red stop light or stop sign. If this happens, TAKE IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION!

The visual and audible warnings cancel after a few seconds or when you press the brake pedal, whichever comes first.

Stop Light and Stop Sign Warning provides warnings only. It does not slow down or stop Cybertruck at red traffic lights, stop signs, road markings, etc. If equipped with Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control, you can enable this feature to automatically stop Cybertruck at traffic lights and stop signs (see Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control on page 125).

## Emergency Vehicles

If available in your market region, Cybertruck automatically reduces driving speed when lights from an emergency vehicle are detected when using Autopilot at night on a high speed road. When this happens, the touchscreen displays a message informing you of the slowdown. You will also hear a chime, and see a reminder to keep your hands on the steering wheel. When the light detections pass by or cease to appear, Autopilot resumes your cruising speed. Alternatively, you may tap the accelerator to resume your cruising speed.

Never depend on Autopilot features to determine the presence of emergency vehicles. Cybertruck may not detect lights from emergency vehicles. Keep your eyes on your driving path and always be prepared to take immediate action.

## Take Over Immediately

In situations where Autopilot is unable to steer Cybertruck, a warning chime sounds and the touchscreen displays the following message.

| ⚠️ Take over immediately |
|--------------------------|

When you see this message, take over steering immediately.

# Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control

NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be equipped with Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control, or the feature may not operate exactly as described.

NOTE: Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is a BETA feature and works best on roads that are frequently driven by Tesla vehicles. Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control attempts to stop at all traffic lights and may also stop at green lights.

Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is designed to recognize and respond to traffic lights and stop signs, slowing Cybertruck to a stop when using Traffic-Aware cruise control or Autosteer. This feature uses the vehicle's forward-facing cameras, in addition to GPS data, and slows the car for all detected traffic lights, including green, blinking yellow, and off lights in addition to stop signs and some road markings. As Cybertruck approaches an intersection, the touchscreen displays a notification indicating the intention to slow down. You must confirm that you want to continue or Cybertruck stops at the red line displayed on the touchscreen's driving visualization.

⚠️ WARNING: NEVER make assumptions and predict when and where Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control will stop or continue through an intersection or road marking. From a driver's perspective, the behavior of Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control may appear inconsistent. Always pay attention to the roadway and be prepared to take immediate action. It is the driver's responsibility to determine whether to stop or continue through an intersection. Never depend on Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control to determine when it is safe and/or appropriate to stop or continue through an intersection.

## Before Using

Before using Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control, you must:

- Ensure that forward-facing cameras are unobstructed (see Cleaning a Camera on page 28) and calibrated (see Drive to Calibrate Cameras on page 29). Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control depends on the ability of the cameras to detect traffic lights, stop signs, and road markings.

- Ensure that the latest version of maps has been downloaded to Cybertruck. Although Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control primarily uses visual data received from the vehicle's cameras, greater accuracy is achieved when using the most recent map data. To check which version of maps is currently downloaded, touch Controls > Software. You must connect to a Wi-Fi network to receive updated maps (see Map Updates on page 167).

- Enable the feature. With the vehicle in Park, touch Controls > Autopilot > Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control. Once enabled, Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control operates whenever Traffic-Aware Cruise Control or Autosteer is active.

## How it Works

When Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is enabled and you are using Autosteer, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, or Full Self-Driving (Supervised), the touchscreen displays a popup message to inform you that an upcoming traffic light, stop sign, or road marking has been detected. As it approaches the stop location, even at an intersection where the traffic light is green, Cybertruck slows down and displays a red line to indicate where Cybertruck will stop. To continue through the intersection—even if the traffic light is green —you must briefly press the accelerator pedal to give the vehicle permission to proceed. When you've confirmed that you want to proceed, the red stop line turns gray and Cybertruck continues through the intersection and resumes your set cruising speed.

NOTE: If Cybertruck is approaching a green light and detects that a vehicle in front of you is continuing through the intersection, Cybertruck continues through the intersection without requiring your confirmation, provided you are not in a turning lane and the vehicle can detect that your hands are on the steering wheel.

NOTE: If, after you briefly press the accelerator pedal to confirm that you want to continue through the intersection, the traffic signal changes before you enter the intersection (for example, the light changes from green to yellow or from yellow to red), Cybertruck may determine that it is not appropriate to proceed. Therefore, Cybertruck stops and you must press the accelerator to proceed. At all times, it is your responsibility to ensure the vehicle stops or accelerates appropriately and safely.

⚠️ WARNING: Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control DOES NOT turn Cybertruck through an intersection unless Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is engaged. When in a turning lane, Cybertruck stops at the red stop line. To proceed, briefly press the accelerator pedal— Cybertruck continues straight through the intersection (even when in a turning lane), so you MUST manually steer Cybertruck through the intersection (which cancels Autosteer).

Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is designed to operate as described only when the following conditions are met:

- Autosteer, Full Self-Driving (Supervised), or Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is engaged.

- The cameras can detect an upcoming traffic light, stop sign or road marking (for example, cameras are unobstructed and have a clear line-of-sight to the traffic light, stop sign, or road marking).

- The touchscreen on Cybertruck is displaying an upcoming traffic light in "bold" format. Cybertruck does not acknowledge traffic lights that the touchscreen shows as faded. If a traffic light is not directly ahead of the camera (for example, it is located at an angle of the camera's view, or located in an adjacent lane) the touchscreen displays it as faded and Cybertruck does not slow down and stop for it.
---
# Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control

⚠️ WARNING: If the touchscreen is not displaying a red stop line at an upcoming intersection, Cybertruck does not slow down or stop. It is the driver's responsibility to pay attention to upcoming intersections and monitor traffic conditions to determine when and if the vehicle should stop and then to take appropriate action as needed.

⚠️ WARNING: Never depend on Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control to determine whether to stop at, or proceed through, an intersection. Drive attentively by watching the road and paying attention to the roadway, upcoming intersections, traffic conditions, crosswalks, and other road users. It is always the driver's responsibility to determine whether to stop or proceed. Be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to do so can result in injury or death.

⚠️ WARNING: In some situations, Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control may inaccurately detect a traffic light or stop sign, causing Cybertruck to slow down unexpectedly. Be prepared to take immediate action at all times.

⚠️ WARNING: You must briefly press the accelerator pedal to confirm that you want to proceed through an intersection, regardless of the status of the traffic light. If you do not confirm, Cybertruck stops at the red stop line displayed on the touchscreen, even if stopping may be inappropriate. Stopping at a green light may confuse other drivers and may result in a collision, injury or death. Therefore, always pay attention to upcoming intersections and be prepared to manually brake or accelerate in response to surroundings.

⚠️ WARNING: Never assume that your ability to see a traffic light, stop sign, or road marking (especially at a complex intersection, or an intersection in which a traffic light or sign is partially obstructed, etc.) means that Cybertruck can also see it and respond appropriately.

⚠️ WARNING: Even the most recent map data does not include all traffic lights and stop signs. Therefore, Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control relies heavily on the ability of the cameras to detect traffic lights, stop signs, road markings, etc. As a result, Cybertruck may ignore an intersection that is blocked from the camera's view (for example, obstructed by a tree or a large vehicle or object, or located near a steep hill or sharp curve).

⚠️ WARNING: Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is not a substitute for attentive driving and sound judgment.

126                                                               Owner's Manual

# Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control

## Traffic Lights

When driving with Autosteer or Traffic-Aware Cruise Control engaged, and Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control enabled, Cybertruck is designed to respond as follows when approaching intersections controlled by a traffic light:

| Type of Traffic Light | Vehicle Intended Response |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Green light | At a solid green traffic light, or at a traffic light that is currently off (not illuminated), Cybertruck slows down.<br><br>If you are following a car in front of you that continues through the intersection, the touchscreen displays a green stop line and provided your hands are detected on the steering wheel, Cybertruck also continues.<br><br>If a car is not in front of you, the touchscreen displays a red stop line. You must confirm that you want to continue through the intersection by briefly pressing the accelerator pedal. If you don't confirm, Cybertruck stops at the red stop line displayed on the touchscreen.<br><br>NOTE: Cybertruck resumes the set cruising speed when it continues through the intersection, taking into consideration the speed of a vehicle in front of you. |
| Yellow light | Cybertruck slows down and comes to a complete stop at the red stop line displayed on the touchscreen. When you want to continue through the intersection (for example, the light turns green again, or once Cybertruck has come to a complete stop), you must briefly press the accelerator pedal. |
| Red light | Cybertruck slows down and comes to a complete stop at the red stop line displayed on the touchscreen. When you want to proceed through the intersection (for example, the light turns green again), you must briefly press the accelerator pedal. |
| Green to yellow light transition | NOTE: If the traffic light changes after you've confirmed that you want to proceed (for example, a green traffic light turns yellow), Cybertruck may stop instead of continuing, especially if Cybertruck determines that it can safely stop before entering the intersection.<br><br>NOTE: Cybertruck is not designed to proceed through an intersection when the traffic light is red or if the light turns yellow in situations when there is adequate distance to safely stop before entering the intersection.<br><br>NOTE: You can take over driving at any time by manually braking to cancel Autosteer or Traffic-Aware Cruise Control. |

| Type of Traffic Light | Vehicle Intended Response |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Yellow light changing to red | |
| Red light changing to green | |
| Green light | Cybertruck slows down. To proceed, you must briefly press the accelerator pedal. If you don't, Cybertruck stops at the red stop line displayed on the touchscreen.<br><br>NOTE: To prevent Cybertruck from stopping, and to minimize how much it slows down as it approaches, you can confirm that you want to proceed by briefly pressing the accelerator pedal at any time after the touchscreen displays the red stop line. Cybertruck resumes your set cruising speed immediately after you confirm (taking into consideration the speed of a vehicle in front of you).<br><br>⚠️ WARNING: Approach attentively and be prepared to press the brake pedal to slow down or stop. |
| Yellow light | |
| Red light | Cybertruck slows down and comes to a complete stop at the red stop line displayed on the touchscreen. When you want to proceed through the intersection (for example, traffic laws and conditions indicate it is safe and legal to proceed), you must briefly press the accelerator pedal. |
---
# Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control

## Stop Signs and Road Markings

When driving with Autosteer or Traffic-Aware Cruise Control engaged, and Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control enabled, Cybertruck is designed to respond as follows when approaching intersections controlled by stop signs, stop lines, or road markings:

| Type of Intersection | Vehicle Intended Response |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| No Traffic Control   | Cybertruck assumes the right of way and continues straight without slowing down or stopping. |
| Arm of T-junction    |  |
| End of T-junction    | If Cybertruck detects a T-junction based on the map data, Cybertruck slows down and comes to a complete stop at the red stop line displayed on the touchscreen. When you want to proceed, you must take over steering and acceleration. <br><br> ⚠️ **WARNING**: Cybertruck may not stop at a T-junction that does not have a stop sign or stop line, or if the T-junction is not included in the map data. Drive attentively and be prepared to stop (when necessary and/or appropriate). |
| Stop Sign            | Cybertruck slows down and comes to a complete stop at the red stop line displayed on the touchscreen. When you want to proceed through the intersection, you must briefly press the accelerator pedal. <br><br> **NOTE**: If you confirm that you want to proceed through an intersection controlled by a stop sign by briefly pressing the accelerator pedal before Cybertruck has stopped, your confirmation is ignored. Cybertruck is not designed to proceed through a stop sign without stopping. <br><br> **NOTE**: Even when using Autosteer, and even if you have engaged a turn signal, you must turn the steering wheel yourself (which cancels Autosteer) to complete a turn at an intersection. |

| Road Marking | |

⚠️ WARNING: Cybertruck also slows down and stops at a roundabout. You must take over steering (which cancels Autosteer) and briefly press the accelerator pedal to confirm that you want to continue through the roundabout.

⚠️ WARNING: At crosswalks, Cybertruck may slow down and may stop, depending on whether the crosswalk is controlled by a traffic light and whether the cameras detect pedestrians, bicyclists, etc. in the crosswalk. Pay particular attention at crosswalks and be prepared to take over at any time. Failure to do so can result in injury or death.

## Limitations

Depending on many different circumstances and environmental conditions, Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control may or may not stop at:

- Railroad crossings.
- Keep-out zones.
- Toll booths.
- Crosswalk systems.
- Yield signs or temporary traffic lights and stop signs (such as at construction areas).
- Miscellaneous traffic U-turn lights, bicycle and pedestrian crossing lights, lane availability lights, etc.

In addition, Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is particularly unlikely to operate as intended, can disengage, or may not operate, when one or more of the following conditions are present:

- Driving through consecutive light-controlled intersections that are very close to each other.
- Visibility is poor (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or weather conditions are interfering with camera operation.
- Bright light (such as direct sunlight) is interfering with the view of the camera(s).
- A camera is obstructed, covered, damaged, or not properly calibrated.

# Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control

- Driving on a hill or on a road that has sharp curves on which the cameras are unable to see upcoming traffic lights or stop signs.
- A traffic light, stop sign, or road marking is obstructed (for example, a tree, a large vehicle, etc.).
- Cybertruck is being driven very close to a vehicle in front of it, which is blocking the view of a camera.

⚠️ WARNING: The limitations listed above are not an exhaustive list of reasons why Cybertruck may not operate as expected. Many unforeseen circumstances can adversely impact the accurate operation of Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control. Using this feature does not reduce or eliminate the need to drive attentively and responsibly. You must be prepared to take appropriate and immediate action at all times.

Autopilot                                                                                                                        131

# Autopark

NOTE: Depending on date of manufacture, software version, and vehicle configuration, your vehicle may not be equipped with the following features, or a feature may not operate exactly as described.

Autopark uses data to simplify parking on public roads by maneuvering Cybertruck into parallel and perpendicular parking spaces.

⚠️ WARNING: It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the limitations of Autopark and the situations in which it may not work as expected. For more information, see Limitations and Warnings on page 138.

⚠️ CAUTION: Do not use Autopark if anything, such as a ball hitch, bike rack, or trailer, is attached to the tow hitch. Do not use Autopark if there is cargo overhanging past the end of the cargo bed (such a long slats of wood, poles, pipes, etc.).

Autopark is disabled when:

- A bicycle is detected.
- The tailgate is down.
- Cybertruck is in Trailer Mode (see Trailer Mode on page 111).
- Cybertruck is in Off-Road Mode (see Off-Road Modes on page 102).

⚠️ CAUTION: Autopark's performance depends on the ability of the cameras to determine the vehicle's proximity to curbs, objects, and other vehicles. Ensure all cameras are clean and free of obstructions before each drive and before using Autopilot features (see Cleaning a Camera on page 28). Dirty cameras as well as environmental conditions such as rain and faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance. If a camera is obstructed or blinded, Cybertruck displays a message on the touchscreen and Autopilot features may not be available. For more information on specific alerts, see Troubleshooting Alerts on page 242.

## Parameters

Autopark detects potential parking spaces based on the following parameters:

### Perpendicular Parking

- Your driving speed must be below 8 mph (13 km/h). If driving too fast, Autopark may not be able to accurately detect your desired parking space.
- The parking space must be at least as wide as your vehicle.
- The parking space must have at least three visible lines for the vehicle to park into, such as parking lines, road markings, or distinct curbs. Autopark may not work in a garage, for example, without three visible parking lines.
- Autopark may not work with textured road surfaces such as cobblestone or brick.

### Parallel Parking

- Your driving speed must be below 8 mph (13 km/h). If driving too fast, Autopark may not be able to accurately detect your desired parking space.
- There must be a vehicle in front of or behind the space you want to park in.

NOTE: Autopark does not operate on angled parking spaces.

## To Use Autopark

When driving, follow these steps to allow Autopark to maneuver Cybertruck into a parking space:

1. While driving slowly, monitor the touchscreen (after making sure that it is safe to do so) to see potential parking spaces detected by Autopilot.

NOTE: The detected parking spaces appear only if the vehicle's position and/or the circumstances of the surrounding area are such that Autopark can determine an appropriate driving path. If Autopark cannot determine an appropriate path (for example, when driving on a narrow street where moving into the parking space causes the front of the vehicle to extend into the adjacent lane), you can either reposition the vehicle, find a different parking space, or park manually.

2. Choose a spot, then release the steering wheel and touch Start on the touchscreen.

3. Autopark displays a message when parking is complete.

If you press the brake pedal when Autopark is actively parking Cybertruck, the parking process cancels.

⚠️ CAUTION: Cybertruck does not brake if you choose to override the current speed by pressing the accelerator pedal while Autopark is active. In this case, Autopark cancels if you exceed 6 mph (10 km/h).

⚠️ WARNING: Never depend on Autopark to find a parking space that is legal, suitable, and safe. Autopark may not always detect objects in the parking space. Always perform visual checks to confirm that a parking space is appropriate and safe.

⚠️ WARNING: When Autopark is actively steering Cybertruck:

- Do not interfere with the movement of the steering wheel. Doing so cancels Autopark.
- Continually check your surroundings. Be prepared to apply the brakes to avoid vehicles, pedestrians, or objects.
- Monitor the touchscreen to ensure that you are aware of the instructions that Autopark is providing.

# Autopark

## To Cancel Parking

Autopark cancels the parking sequence when:

- You manually move the steering wheel.
- You shift.
- You press the brake pedal.
- You press the right scroll button on the steering wheel.
- The parking sequence exceeds seven moves.

## Take Over Immediately

In situations where Autopark is unable to steer Cybertruck, Autopark sounds a warning chime and displays the message Take Over Immediately.

This happens when:

- Cybertruck detects that a door is opened or that the driver is exiting the vehicle.
- One or more of the cameras is damaged, dirty, obstructed (such as by mud, ice, or snow, or by adhesive products such as wraps, stickers, etc.), or has poor visibility (due to heavy rain, snow, hail, etc. or poor lighting).
- Your speed exceeds 6 mph (10 km/h).
- An Automatic Emergency Braking event occurs (see Collision Avoidance Assist on page 144).

When you see this message, take over immediately.

# Full Self-Driving (Supervised)

NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be equipped with Full Self-Driving (Supervised) (also referred to as Autosteer on City Streets), or the feature may not operate exactly as described.

CAUTION: As Full Self-Driving (Supervised) deployment expands, Tesla will gradually make it available to eligible customers in select countries outside of the United States and Canada. Because every country contains unique infrastructure, driving behaviors, and traffic patterns that Full Self-Driving (Supervised) must adapt to over time, it is essential for drivers using Full Self-Driving (Supervised) in newly eligible countries to be extra attentive and overly cautious. You must be ready to take over safely at any time.

When Full Self-Driving (Supervised) (also referred to as Autosteer on City Streets) is engaged, Cybertruck attempts to drive to your destination by following curves in the road, stopping at and negotiating intersections, making left and right turns, navigating roundabouts, and entering/exiting highways.

Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is meant to work in a variety of driving scenarios. You can use Full Self-Driving (Supervised) on any type of roadway, including residential and city streets.

WARNING: Driver intervention may be required in certain situations, such as on narrow roads with oncoming cars, in construction zones, or while going through complex intersections. For more examples of scenarios in which driver intervention might be required, see Limitations and Warnings on page 138.

Full Self-Driving (Supervised) uses inputs from cameras mounted at the front, rear, left, and right of Cybertruck to build a model of the area surrounding Cybertruck (see Cameras on page 27). The Full Self-Driving computer installed in Cybertruck is designed to use this input, rapidly process neural networks, and make decisions to safely guide you to your destination.

NOTE: As Tesla's Full Self-Driving (Supervised) capabilities evolve, Cybertruck is upgraded through over-the-air software updates. Download updates as soon as they become available.

Like other Autopilot features, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) requires a fully attentive driver and will display a series of escalating warnings requiring driver response. You must keep your hands on the steering wheel while Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is engaged.

WARNING: Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is a hands-on feature that requires you to pay attention to the road at all times. Keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times, be mindful of road conditions and surrounding traffic, pay attention to pedestrians and cyclists, and always be prepared to take immediate action (especially around blind corners, crossing intersections, and in narrow driving situations). Failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury or death. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the limitations of Full Self-Driving (Supervised) and the situations in which it may not work as expected. For more information, see Limitations and Warnings on page 138.

CAUTION: Use of Full Self-Driving (Supervised) will be suspended if improper usage is detected. For more information, see Autopilot Suspension on page 136.

## Before Using Full Self-Driving (Supervised)

1. Enable Full Self-Driving (Supervised). Touch Controls > Autopilot > Full Self-Driving (Supervised) and then, after carefully reading and understanding the popup window, touch Yes.

2. Ensure that the cameras on Cybertruck are unobstructed and calibrated (see Cameras on page 27). Full Self-Driving (Supervised) depends on the ability of the cameras to detect traffic lights, stop signs, and road markings.

3. Ensure that the latest version of maps has been downloaded to Cybertruck (see Map Updates on page 167). Although Full Self-Driving (Supervised) primarily uses visual data received from the vehicle's cameras, greater accuracy is achieved when using the most recent map data.

## To Use Full Self-Driving (Supervised)

Once Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is enabled, activate it by pressing the right scroll button on the steering wheel.

1. Enter a destination. If you do not choose a destination, Cybertruck chooses the most probable driving path or suggests a destination based on your driving.

2. When the touchscreen displays the gray steering wheel icon, press the right scroll wheel.

You can engage Full Self-Driving (Supervised) at any speed less than 85 mph (150 km/h), including when Cybertruck is at a standstill.

| Icon | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Gray steering wheel icon | To indicate that Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is available but not engaged, the top corner of the touchscreen displays a gray steering wheel icon next to the driving gear. |
| Blue steering wheel icon | When Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is engaged, the steering wheel icon is blue and a blue line represents your driving path. |

# Full Self-Driving (Supervised)

When Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is engaged, the touchscreen displays a visualization of the environment surrounding Cybertruck, including the roadway and detected objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, curbs, bicyclists, and more. Objects that are highlighted on the visualization represent priorities that Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is actively controlling for at a given time.

NOTE: The Full Self-Driving (Supervised) visualization may not be a holistic representation of the objects, road markings, road signals, and other variables that Full Self-Driving (Supervised) takes into account as it attempts to drive to your destination. While Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is engaged, it uses data from the cameras on Cybertruck that may not be represented in the visualization (see Cameras on page 27).

The visualization will also inform you of the system's intended action by displaying a message on the touchscreen, such as when the vehicle is slowly creeping for visibility to take a turn at an intersection.

You can widen the visualization area to fullscreen. Enable the setting by touching Controls > Autopilot > Full Self-Driving (Supervised) > Expanded Full Self-Driving Visualization. Then on the touchscreen, swipe the visualization window handle to fill the entire screen.

NOTE: You can override Full Self-Driving (Supervised) at any time if you are uncomfortable or uncertain about the system's intended course of action. You are driving Cybertruck at all times.

## Canceling Full Self-Driving (Supervised)

To disengage Full Self-Driving (Supervised), do any of the following:

- Press the brake pedal.
- Press the right scroll wheel on the steering wheel
- Take over and steer manually.

When you disengage Full Self-Driving (Supervised) by steering manually, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control remains active.

In addition, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) will disengage if any of the following occurs:

- You shift out of Drive.
- A door or trunk is opened.
- There is an Automatic Emergency Braking event (see Collision Avoidance Assist on page 144).
- The driver's seatbelt is released, and/or the driver gets out of their seat.
- You do not respond to repeated reminders to keep your hands on the wheel and subsequent messages on the touchscreen.

- Full Self-Driving (Supervised) becomes unavailable. This can happen for a number of reasons (for example, if a camera becomes obscured). If Full Self-Driving (Supervised) disengages, an alert will appear on the touchscreen to notify you and a chime will sound. If this happens, take control of steering immediately.

When driver intervention is required, it is best to safely disengage as soon as possible. It is recommended to practice disengaging from Full Self-Driving (Supervised) in safe environment without other road users so you may become familiar with the process.

## While Using Full Self-Driving (Supervised)

Full Self-Driving (Supervised) changes lanes, makes left and right turns, follows on- and off-ramps, and takes forks in the road as necessary to reach the destination.

WARNING: NEVER make assumptions and predict when and where Full Self-Driving (Supervised) will stop or continue through an intersection or road marking. From a driver's perspective, the behavior of Full Self-Driving (Supervised) may appear inconsistent. Always pay attention to the roadway and be prepared to take immediate action. It is the driver's responsibility to determine whether to stop or continue through an intersection. Never depend on Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to determine when it is safe and/or appropriate to stop or continue through an intersection.

Full Self-Driving (Supervised) maintains your speed and following distance from the vehicle ahead of Cybertruck, if there is one. Full Self-Driving (Supervised) also slows down and stops at traffic lights and stop signs as necessary, and reacts to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles on the road.

For example, if you are driving on a residential street and another vehicle backs out of a driveway ahead of Cybertruck, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) slows down or stops as appropriate. If the other vehicle stops backing out while partially blocking the driving lane, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) slows down and maneuvers around the other vehicle if the width of the lane allows it.

When the traffic in front of you is slowing down, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) shows blue arrows in the driving lane and slows down to maintain an appropriate following distance from the vehicle ahead of you. When you are driving on the highway, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) displays a message on the touchscreen to inform you when an action (such as a lane change) is being taken.

WARNING: In rare cases, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) may not appropriately slow down, come to a stop, or resume control for a stop sign or traffic light. You may assist the system by lightly applying the accelerator, or can override Full Self-Driving (Supervised) at any time.

Autopilot                                                                                                                                         135

# Full Self-Driving (Supervised)

## Changing Lanes

To tell Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to change lanes while on a multi-lane roadway, engage the right or left turn signal. On city or residential streets, engaging the right or left turn signal tells Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to make a right or left turn, respectively.

Unlike Navigate on Autopilot, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) does not require confirmation before a lane change. To cancel a lane change or turn, cancel the turn signal or intervene with the steering wheel or other vehicle controls.

## Changing the Set Speed

While Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is active, roll the right scroll wheel up to increase, or down to decrease, the set speed.

NOTE: In some cases, your speed is limited by the speed limit, the type of roadway, or the flow of traffic. If this is the case, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) displays a message at the top of the visualization.

## Arriving at Your Destination

Once you reach your destination, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) stops Cybertruck and displays a message indicating that navigation is complete.

## Driver Attentiveness

Like other Autopilot features, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) requires that the driver pay attention to the road, their surroundings, and other road users.

The cabin camera monitors continued driver attentiveness when Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is engaged. This system cannot be disabled. The cabin camera does not require full visibility of the driver's eyes in order to monitor attentiveness. The system is still active, for example, if the driver is wearing sunglasses.

If the cabin camera does not have clear visibility of the driver's hand and arm locations, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) periodically displays a message reminding the driver to apply slight force to the steering wheel.

When the cabin camera is actively monitoring driver attentiveness, a green dot appears next to the steering wheel icon on the touchscreen.

If the driver repeatedly looks away from the road, the touchscreen displays a warning. The warning is dismissed once the driver begins paying attention to the road again.

If the driver repeatedly ignore prompts to apply slight force to the steering wheel or to pay attention, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) displays a series of escalating warnings and, if those warnings are ignored, disables for the rest of the drive and displays the following message.

> Autopilot unavailable for current drive. Autopilot Strikeout - Attention warnings ignored.

If the driver does not resume manual steering, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) sounds a continuous chime, turns on the warning flashers, and slows the vehicle to a complete stop.

WARNING: Do not use handheld devices while using Full Self-Driving (Supervised). If the cabin camera detects a handheld device while Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is engaged, the touchscreen displays a message reminding you to keep your hands on the wheel.

WARNING: The use of devices designed to circumvent driver attentiveness is a violation of the terms of use for Full Self-Driving (Supervised) and may result in the feature being permanently disabled on your vehicle and a ban on future use of the feature.

## Autopilot Suspension

Use of Autopilot features will be suspended if improper usage is detected.

Use of Autosteer and Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is suspended for a week when you or another driver of your vehicle receives Autopilot "strikeouts." A strikeout is when the Autopilot system disengages for the remainder of a trip after the driver receives several audio and visual warnings for inattentiveness.

You can see how many strikeouts are remaining before Autopilot access is suspended by touching Controls > Autopilot.

A strikeout is forgiven after 7 days, as long as you don't receive another strikeout in that time.

NOTE: If your access to Autosteer and Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is suspended, you can still use Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and all active safety features are still enabled.

There may be occasions where driver intervention is required and you must take over immediately to maintain safe driving. Driver-initiated disengagements do not count as improper usage and are expected from the driver.

## Take Over Immediately

In situations where Autopilot is unable to steer Cybertruck, a warning chime sounds and the touchscreen displays the following message.
---
# Full Self-Driving (Supervised)

Warning icon **Take over immediately**

When you see this message, take over steering immediately.

Autopilot                                                                                   137

# Limitations and Warnings

This topic includes warnings, cautions, and limitations pertaining to the following Autopilot features.

- Traffic-Aware Cruise Control on page 138
- Full Self-Driving (Supervised) (Autosteer on City Streets) on page 139
- Autopark on page 139

NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be equipped with all features listed above, or a feature may not operate as described.

⚠️ WARNING: Read the following warnings and limitations carefully before using Autopilot. Failure to follow all warnings and instructions can result in property damage, serious injury, or death.

NOTE: Ensure all cameras are clean and free of obstructions before each drive and before using Autopilot features (see Cleaning a Camera on page 28). Dirty cameras as well as environmental conditions such as rain and faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance. If a camera is obstructed or blinded, Cybertruck displays a message on the touchscreen and Autopilot features may not be available. For more information on specific alerts, see Troubleshooting Alerts on page 242.

## Traffic-Aware Cruise Control

While using Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, it is the driver's responsibility to stay alert, drive safely, and be in control of the vehicle at all times. Always keep your eyes on the road when driving and be prepared to take corrective action as needed.

In addition, it is the driver's responsibility to cruise at a safe speed and maintain a safe following distance based on road conditions and applicable speed limits. Be aware of the following limitations while Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is active.

- There may be situations where the cruising speed may not change when the speed limit changes.
- Traffic-Aware Cruise Control does not adapt driving speed based on road and driving conditions. Do not use Traffic-Aware Cruise Control on winding roads with sharp curves, on icy or slippery road surfaces, or when weather conditions (such as heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) make it inappropriate to drive at a consistent speed.
- Do not rely on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to maintain an accurate or appropriate following distance.
- Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may be unable to provide adequate speed control because of limited braking capability and hills. It can also misjudge the distance from a vehicle ahead. Driving downhill can increase driving speed, causing Cybertruck to exceed your set speed (and potentially the road's speed limit).
- Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may occasionally cause Cybertruck to brake when not required or when you are not expecting it. This can be caused by closely following a vehicle ahead, detecting vehicles or objects in adjacent lanes (especially on curves), etc.
- Due to limitations inherent in the onboard GPS (Global Positioning System), you may experience situations in which Cybertruck slows down, especially near exits or off-ramps where a curve is detected and/or you are navigating to a destination and not following the route.
- In some cases (such as having insufficient data), Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may not automatically reduce the set speed on the highway interchange or off-ramp.
- Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may not detect all objects and, especially when cruising over 50 mph (80 km/h), may not brake/decelerate when a vehicle or object is only partially in the driving lane or when a vehicle you are following moves out of your driving path and a stationary or slow-moving vehicle or object is in front of you.
- Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may react to vehicles or objects that either do not exist, or are not in your lane of travel, causing Cybertruck to slow down unnecessarily or inappropriately.

⚠️ WARNING: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is particularly unlikely to operate as intended in the following types of situations:

- The road has sharp curves or significant changes in elevation.
- Road signs and signals are unclear, ambiguous, or poorly maintained.
- Visibility is poor (due to heavy rain, snow, hail, etc. or poorly lit roadways at night)
- You are driving in a tunnel or next to a highway divider that interferes with the view of the camera(s)
- Bright light (such as from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight) interferes with the view of the camera(s).

⚠️ WARNING: The list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of Traffic-Aware Cruise Control. Traffic-Aware Cruise Control can cancel unexpectedly at any time for unforeseen reasons. Always watch the road in front of you and stay prepared to take appropriate action. It is the driver's responsibility to be in control of Cybertruck at all times.

⚠️ WARNING: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is designed for your driving comfort and convenience and is not a collision warning or avoidance system. Never depend on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to adequately slow down Cybertruck. Always watch the road in front of you and be prepared to take corrective action at all times. Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death.
---
# Limitations and Warnings

⚠️ WARNING: Although Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is capable of detecting pedestrians and cyclists, never depend on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to adequately slow Cybertruck down for them. Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death.

⚠️ WARNING: Cybertruck may quickly and suddenly make unexpected maneuvers or mistakes that require immediate driver intervention.

The list above represents only a fraction of the possible scenarios that can cause Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to make sudden maneuvers and behave unexpectedly. In fact, Cybertruck can suddenly swerve even when driving conditions appear normal and straight-forward. Stay alert and always pay attention to the roadway so you can anticipate the need to take corrective action as early as possible. Remember that this is an early access feature that must be used with extra caution.

## Full Self-Driving (Supervised)
(Autosteer on City Streets)

⚠️ WARNING: Always remember that Full Self-Driving (Supervised) (also known as Autosteer on City Streets) does not make Cybertruck autonomous and requires a fully attentive driver who is ready to take immediate action at all times.

⚠️ WARNING: Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is a hands-on feature. Keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times, be mindful of road conditions and surrounding traffic, and always be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury or death. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the limitations of Full Self-Driving (Supervised) and the situations in which it may not work as expected.

⚠️ WARNING: Failure to follow all warnings and instructions can result in property damage, serious injury or death.

⚠️ CAUTION: Full Self-Driving (Supervised) and its associated functions may not operate as intended and there are numerous situations in which driver intervention may be needed. Examples include (but are not limited to):

- Interactions with pedestrians, bicyclists, and other road users.
- Unprotected turns with high-speed cross traffic.
- Multi-lane turns.
- Simultaneous lane changes.
- Narrow roads with oncoming cars or double-parked vehicles.
- Rare objects such as trailers, ramps, cargo, open doors, etc. protruding from vehicles.
- Merges onto high-traffic, high-speed roads.
- Debris in the road.
- Construction zones.
- High curvature roads, particularly at fast driving speeds.

Visibility is critical for Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to operate. Low visibility, such as low light or poor weather conditions (rain, snow, direct sun, fog, etc.) can significantly degrade performance.

⚠️ CAUTION: As Full Self-Driving (Supervised) deployment expands, Tesla will gradually make it available to eligible customers in select countries outside the United States. Because every country contains unique infrastructure, driving behaviors, and traffic patterns that Full Self-Driving (Supervised) must adapt to over time, it is essential for drivers using Full Self-Driving (Supervised) in newly eligible countries to be extra attentive and overly cautious. You must be ready to take over safely at any time.

## Autopark

⚠️ CAUTION: Autopark's performance depends on the ability of the cameras to determine the vehicle's proximity to curbs, objects, and other vehicles. Be aware of the following warnings before and while using Autopark:

- Do not use Autopark if anything, such as a ball hitch, bike rack, or trailer, is attached to the tow hitch. Autopark may not stop for hitches when parking between or in front of other vehicles.
- Never depend on Autopark to find a parking space that is legal, suitable, and safe. Autopark may not always detect objects in the parking space. Always perform visual checks to confirm that a parking space is appropriate and safe.
- When Autopark is actively steering Cybertruck, the steering wheel moves in accordance with Autopark's adjustments. Do not interfere with the movement of the steering wheel. Doing so cancels Autopark.
- During the parking sequence, continually check your surroundings. Be prepared to apply the brakes to avoid vehicles, pedestrians, or objects.
- When Autopark is active, monitor the touchscreen to ensure that you are aware of the instructions that Autopark is providing.
---
# Limitations and Warnings

⚠️ CAUTION:

Autopark is particularly unlikely to operate as intended in these situations:

- The road is sloped. Autopark is designed to operate on flat roads only.
- Visibility is poor (due to heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.).
- The curb is constructed of material other than stone, or the curb cannot be detected.
- The target parking space is directly adjacent to a wall or pillar (for example, the last parking space of a row in an underground parking structure).
- One or more of the cameras is damaged, dirty, or obstructed (such as by mud, ice, or snow, or by a vehicle bra, excessive paint, or adhesive products such as wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.).
- Weather conditions (heavy rain, snow, fog, or extremely hot or cold temperatures) are interfering with sensor (if equipped) operation.

⚠️ WARNING: Many unforeseen circumstances can impair Autopark's ability to park Cybertruck. Keep this in mind and remember that as a result, Autopark may not steer Cybertruck appropriately. Pay attention when parking Cybertruck and stay prepared to immediately take control.
---
# Lane Assist

Cybertruck monitors the markers on the lane you are driving in as well as the surrounding areas for the presence of vehicles or other objects.

⚠️ WARNING: Ensure all cameras are clean and free of obstructions before each drive and before using Autopilot features (see Cleaning a Camera on page 28). Dirty cameras as well as environmental conditions such as rain and faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance. If a camera is obstructed or blinded, Cybertruck displays a message on the touchscreen and Autopilot features may not be available. For more information on specific alerts, see Troubleshooting Alerts on page 242.

⚠️ WARNING: Lane Assist features are for guidance purposes only and are not intended to replace your own direct visual checks. Before changing lanes, always use side mirrors and perform the appropriate shoulder checks to visually determine if it is safe and appropriate to change lanes.

⚠️ WARNING: Never depend on Lane Assist to inform you if you unintentionally drive outside of the driving lane, or to inform you that there is a vehicle beside you or in your blind spot. Several external factors can reduce the performance of Lane Assist (see Limitations and Inaccuracies on page 142). It is the driver's responsibility to stay alert and pay attention to the driving lane and other road users. Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death.

## Lane Departure Avoidance

NOTE: Depending on date of manufacture, software version, and vehicle configuration, your vehicle may not be equipped with Lane Departure Avoidance, or the feature may not operate exactly as described.

Lane Departure Avoidance is designed to warn you if Cybertruck is drifting out of, or nears the edge of, your driving lane.

Lane Departure Avoidance operates when driving between 40 and 90 mph (64 and 145 km/h) on roads with clearly visible lane markings. You can choose if and how you want Lane Departure Warning to operate by touching Controls > Autopilot > Lane Departure Avoidance and selecting between these options:

- Off: You are not warned of lane departures or potential collisions with a vehicle in an adjacent lane.
- Warning: If a front wheel passes over a lane marking, the touchscreen displays a warning. (For vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving (Supervised): if a front wheel passes over a lane marking, the steering wheel vibrates.)
- Assist: Corrective steering is applied to keep Cybertruck in a safe position if Cybertruck drifts into an adjacent lane or near the edge of the road.

When Lane Departure Avoidance is enabled and Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is active, if Cybertruck drifts out of the driving lane when the associated turn signal is off, Lane Assist also checks to see whether your hands are on the steering wheel. If hands are not detected, the displays a series of alerts, similar to those that are used when driving with Autosteer. If hands are repeatedly not detected Cybertruck gradually slows down to 15 mph (25 km/h) below the detected speed limit, or below the set cruising speed, and the hazard lights start flashing.

NOTE: Lane Departure Avoidance does not warn you of lane departures, or provide steering interventions, if the associated turn signal is on, which indicates an intentional lane change.

⚠️ WARNING: Lane Departure Avoidance is intended to help keep you safe, but it does not work in every situation and does not replace the need to remain attentive and in control.

⚠️ WARNING: Keep your hands on the steering wheel and drive attentively at all times.

⚠️ WARNING: Steering interventions are minimal and are not designed to move Cybertruck out of its driving lane. Do not rely on steering interventions to avoid side collisions.

## Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance

NOTE: Depending on date of manufacture, software version, and vehicle configuration, your vehicle may not be equipped with Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance, or the feature may not operate exactly as described.

Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance automatically applies steering to avoid a potential collision in situations where:

- Cybertruck is departing a lane and may collide with a vehicle traveling in the same direction in the adjacent lane (regardless of the status of the turn signal).
- Cybertruck is departing a lane into an oncoming lane, the turn signal is off, and an oncoming vehicle is detected.
- Cybertruck is departing the road and the turn signal is off (for example, very close to the edge of the road and a collision may occur).

To turn this feature on or off, touch Controls > Autopilot > Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance.

When Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance applies steering, a chime sounds and the displays a warning and highlights the lane marking in red.

Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance operates when Cybertruck is traveling between 40 and 90 mph (64 and 145 km/h) on a road with clearly visible lane markings, curbs, etc.

Active Safety Features                                                                                                                141
---
# Lane Assist

WARNING: Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance is not a substitute for attentive driving and sound judgment. Keep your eyes on the road when driving and never depend on Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance to prevent a collision. Several factors can reduce or impair performance. Depending on Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance to prevent a potential collision can result in serious injury or death.

## Blind Spot Assist

### Automatic Blind Spot Camera

You can turn it on/off by touching Controls > Safety > Automatic Blind Spot Camera on the touchscreen.

Once enabled, when the turn signal is engaged, the touchscreen displays the image from the corresponding side repeater camera. You can move the image to a different location on the touchscreen. To do so, touch and drag the image to the new location (valid locations are indicated by shaded areas that display when you touch and hold the image).

WARNING: Automatic Blind Spot Camera does not eliminate the need to drive attentively and manually perform shoulder checks when changing lanes.

WARNING: Do not rely on Blind Spot Warning Light to detect a vehicle in your blind spot. Always visually confirm that a lane is free from obstacles and vehicles before exiting your lane.

### Blind Spot Collision Warning Chime

If you want a chime to sound when a vehicle is in your blind spot and a possible collision is detected, touch Controls > Safety > Blind Spot Collision Warning Chime.

WARNING: Blind Spot Camera does not eliminate the need to drive attentively and manually perform shoulder checks when changing lanes.

WARNING: Blind Spot Collision Warning Chime cannot detect every collision. It is the driver's responsibility to remain alert and perform the appropriate shoulder checks when changing lanes.

### Blind Spot Warning Light

Both front door pillars are equipped with a blind spot warning light in the upper speaker grille. You can enable or disable the warning lights by touching Controls > Safety > Blind Spot Warning Light. When a vehicle is detected in your blind spot in an adjacent lane a red light appears in the upper speaker grille.

- A solid red light indicates a vehicle has been detected in your blind spot.
- A blinking red light indicates that a vehicle is in your blind spot while the turn signal is indicating your intent to turn that direction.
- A rapid blinking red light indicates that a vehicle is detected and immediate corrective action is required to avoid a collision.

## Limitations and Inaccuracies

Lane Assist features cannot always detect lane markings and you may experience unnecessary or invalid warnings when:

- Visibility is poor and lane markings are not clearly visible (due to heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.).
- Bright light (such as from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight) is interfering with the view of the camera(s).
- A vehicle in front of Cybertruck is blocking the view of the camera(s).
- The windshield is obstructing the view of the camera(s) (fogged over, dirty, covered by a sticker, etc.).
- Lane markings are excessively worn, have visible previous markings, have been adjusted due to road construction, or are changing quickly (for example, lanes branching off, crossing over, or merging).
- The road is narrow or winding.
- Objects or landscape features are casting strong shadows on lane markers.

Lane Assist may not provide warnings, or may apply inappropriate warnings, when:

- One or more of the cameras is damaged, dirty, or obstructed (by mud, ice, or snow, or by a vehicle bra, excessive paint, or adhesive products such as wraps, stickers, rubber coatings, etc.).

In addition, Lane Assist may not steer Cybertruck away from an adjacent vehicle, or may apply unnecessary or inappropriate steering, in these situations:

- You are driving Cybertruck on sharp corners or on a curve at a relatively high speed.

# Lane Assist

- Bright light (such as from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight) is interfering with the view of the camera(s).

- You are drifting into another lane but an object (such as a vehicle) is not present.

- A vehicle in another lane cuts in front of you or drifts into your driving lane.

- Cybertruck is not traveling within the speeds at which the Lane Assist feature is designed to operate.

- Weather conditions (heavy rain, snow, fog, or extremely hot or cold temperatures) are interfering with sensor operation.

- Visibility is poor and lane markings are not clearly visible (due to heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.).

- Lane markings are excessively worn, have visible previous markings, have been adjusted due to road construction or are changing quickly (for example, lanes branching off, crossing over, or merging).

⚠️ **CAUTION:** Driver assistance features are automatically disabled when Track Mode is On. It is the driver's responsibility to drive safely and be in control of the vehicle at all times, including on track. Driver Assistance features automatically re-enable when Track Mode is turned Off.

🔺 **WARNING:** The lists above do not represent every possible situation that may interfere with Lane Assist features. There are many reasons why Lane Assist may not operate as intended. To avoid a collision, stay alert and always pay attention to the road so you can anticipate the need to take corrective action as early as possible.

Active Safety Features | 143

# Collision Avoidance Assist

The following collision avoidance features are designed to increase the safety of you and your passengers:

- Forward Collision Warning - provides visual and audible warnings in situations when Cybertruck detects that there is a high risk of a frontal collision (see Forward Collision Warning on page 144).
- Automatic Emergency Braking - automatically applies braking to reduce the impact of a collision (see Automatic Emergency Braking on page 144).
- Obstacle-Aware Acceleration - reduces acceleration if Cybertruck detects an object in its immediate driving path (see Obstacle-Aware Acceleration on page 145).

⚠️ CAUTION: Ensure all cameras are clean and free of obstructions before each drive and before using Autopilot features (see Cleaning a Camera on page 28). Dirty cameras as well as environmental conditions such as rain and faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance. If a camera is obstructed or blinded, Cybertruck displays a message on the touchscreen and Autopilot features may not be available. For more information on specific alerts, see Troubleshooting Alerts on page 242.

⚠️ WARNING: Forward Collision Warning is for guidance purposes only and is not a substitute for attentive driving and sound judgment. Keep your eyes on the road when driving and never depend on Forward Collision Warning to warn you of a potential collision. Several factors can reduce or impair performance, causing either unnecessary, invalid, inaccurate, or missed warnings. Depending on Forward Collision Warning to warn you of a potential collision can result in serious injury or death.

⚠️ WARNING: Automatic Emergency Braking is not designed to prevent all collisions. In certain situations, it can minimize the impact of a collision by attempting to reduce your driving speed. Depending on Automatic Emergency Braking to avoid a collision can result in serious injury or death.

⚠️ WARNING: Obstacle-Aware Acceleration is not designed to prevent a collision. In certain situations, it can minimize the impact of a collision. Depending on Obstacle-Aware Acceleration to avoid a collision can result in serious injury or death.

## Forward Collision Warning

Cybertruck monitors the area in front of it for the presence of an object such as a vehicle, motorcycle, bicycle, or pedestrian. If a collision is considered likely unless you take immediate corrective action, Forward Collision Warning is designed to sound a chime and highlight the vehicle in front of you in red on the touchscreen. If this happens, TAKE IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION!

Visual and audible warnings cancel automatically when the risk of a collision has been reduced (for example, you have decelerated or stopped Cybertruck, or the object in front of your vehicle has moved out of your driving path).

If immediate action is not taken when Cybertruck issues a Forward Collision Warning, Automatic Emergency Braking (if enabled) may automatically apply the brakes if a collision is considered imminent (see ).

By default, Forward Collision Warning is turned on. To turn off or adjust sensitivity, touch Controls > Autopilot > Forward Collision Warning. Instead of the default warning level of Medium, you can turn the warning Off, or you can choose to be warned Late or Early.

NOTE: Your chosen setting is retained until you manually change it.

⚠️ WARNING: The camera(s) associated with Forward Collision Warning are designed to monitor an approximate area of up to 525 feet (160 meters) in your driving path. The area being monitored by Forward Collision Warning can be adversely affected by road and weather conditions. Use appropriate caution when driving.

⚠️ WARNING: Forward Collision Warning is designed only to provide visual and audible alerts. It does not attempt to apply the brakes or decelerate Cybertruck. When seeing and/or hearing a warning, it is the driver's responsibility to take immediate corrective action.

⚠️ WARNING: Forward Collision Warning may provide a warning in situations where the likelihood of collision may not exist. Stay alert and always pay attention to the area in front of Cybertruck so you can anticipate whether any action is required.

Forward Collision Warning operates only when driving between approximately 3 mph (5 km/h) and 124 mph (200 km/h).

⚠️ WARNING: Forward Collision Warning does not provide a warning when the driver is already applying the brake.

## Automatic Emergency Braking

Cybertruck is designed to determine the distance from detected objects. When a collision is considered unavoidable, Automatic Emergency Braking is designed to apply the brakes to reduce the vehicle's speed and therefore, the severity of the impact. The amount of speed that is reduced depends on many factors, including driving speed and environment.

When Automatic Emergency Braking applies the brakes, the touchscreen displays a visual warning and sounds a chime. You may also notice abrupt downward movement of the brake pedal. The brake lights turn on to alert other road users that you are slowing down.

Emergency braking in progress

# Collision Avoidance Assist

Automatic Emergency Braking operates only when driving between approximately 3 mph (5 km/h) and 124 mph (200 km/h).

Automatic Emergency Braking does not apply the brakes, or stops applying the brakes, when:

- You turn the steering wheel sharply.
- You press and release the brake pedal while Automatic Emergency Braking is applying the brakes.
- You accelerate hard while Automatic Emergency Braking is applying the brakes.
- The vehicle, motorcycle, bicycle, or pedestrian is no longer detected in the front or rear of the vehicle.

Automatic Emergency Braking is always enabled when you start Cybertruck. To disable for your current drive, shift into Park and touch Controls > Autopilot > Automatic Emergency Braking. When disabled, the touchscreen displays a visual message.

Automatic Emergency Braking is disabled

> WARNING: It is strongly recommended that you do not disable Automatic Emergency Braking. If you disable it, Cybertruck does not automatically apply the brakes in situations where a collision is considered likely.

NOTE: Automatic Emergency Braking is designed to reduce the impact of frontal collisions only.

NOTE: Automatic Emergency Braking is designed to reduce the impact of frontal and reverse collisions with limited functionality while in Reverse.

In the event Automatic Emergency Braking is unavailable, the touchscreen displays a visual warning.

Automatic Emergency Braking is not available

> WARNING: Automatic Emergency Braking is designed to reduce the severity of an impact. It is not designed to avoid a collision.

> WARNING: Several factors can affect the performance of Automatic Emergency Braking, causing either no braking or inappropriate or untimely braking, such as when a vehicle is partially in the path of travel or there is road debris. It is the driver's responsibility to drive safely and remain in control of the vehicle at all times. Never depend on Automatic Emergency Braking to avoid or reduce the impact of a collision.

> WARNING: Automatic Emergency Braking is not a substitute for maintaining a safe traveling distance between you and the vehicle in front of you.

> WARNING: The brake pedal moves downward abruptly during automatic braking events. Always ensure that the brake pedal can move freely. Do not place material under or on top of the driver's floor mat (including an additional mat) and always ensure that the driver's floor mat is properly secured. Failure to do so can impede the ability of the brake pedal to move freely.

## Obstacle-Aware Acceleration

Obstacle-Aware Acceleration is designed to reduce the impact of a collision by reducing motor torque and in some cases applying the brakes, if Cybertruck detects an object in its driving path. The displays a visual warning and sounds a chime when the brakes are automatically applied. For example, Cybertruck, while parked in front of a closed garage door with Drive engaged, detects that you have pressed hard on the accelerator pedal. Although Cybertruck still accelerates and hits the garage door, the reduced torque may result in less damage.

Obstacle-Aware Acceleration is designed to operate only when all of these conditions are simultaneously met:

- Drive or Reverse is engaged.
- Cybertruck is stopped or traveling less than 10 mph (16 km/h).
- Cybertruck detects an object in its immediate driving path.

To disable Obstacle-Aware Acceleration, touch Controls > Autopilot > Obstacle-Aware Acceleration.

> WARNING: Obstacle-Aware Acceleration is designed to reduce the severity of an impact. It is not designed to avoid a collision.

> WARNING: Obstacle-Aware Acceleration may not limit torque in all situations, such as performing a sharp turn into a parking space. Several factors, including environmental conditions, distance from an obstacle, and a driver's actions, can limit, delay, or inhibit Obstacle-Aware Acceleration.

> WARNING: Do not rely on Obstacle-Aware Acceleration to control acceleration or to avoid, or limit, the severity of a collision, and do not attempt to test Obstacle-Aware Acceleration. Doing so can result in serious property damage, injury, or death.

> WARNING: Several factors can affect the performance of Obstacle-Aware Acceleration, causing an inappropriate or untimely reduction in motor torque. It is the driver's responsibility to drive safely and remain in control of Cybertruck at all times.

## Limitations and Inaccuracies

Collision Avoidance features cannot always detect all objects, vehicles, bikes, or pedestrians, and you may experience unnecessary, inaccurate, invalid, or missed warnings for many reasons, particularly if:

Active Safety Features                                                                                                                   145

# Collision Avoidance Assist

- The road has sharp curves.
- Visibility is poor (due to heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.).
- Bright light (such as from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight) is interfering with the view of the camera(s).
- A camera is obstructed (dirty, covered, fogged over, covered by a sticker, etc.).

CAUTION: If a fault occurs with a Collision Avoidance Assist feature, Cybertruck displays an alert. Contact Tesla Service.

CAUTION: Driver assistance features are automatically disabled when Track Mode is On. It is the driver's responsibility to drive safely and be in control of the vehicle at all times, including on track. Driver Assistance features automatically re-enable when Track Mode is turned Off.

WARNING: The limitations previously described do not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of Collision Avoidance Assist features. These features may fail to provide their intended function for many other reasons. It is the driver's responsibility to avoid collisions by staying alert, paying attention, and taking corrective action as early as possible.

# Speed Assist

## How Speed Assist Works

Cybertruck displays a speed limit on the touchscreen and you can choose if and how you are warned when you exceed the speed limit. In addition, a blue outline may appear around the speed limit icon to notify that you are above the speed limit.

Instead of using the detected speed limit, you can base warnings on an arbitrary speed limit that you enter manually.

In situations where Cybertruck is unable to determine a speed limit, or if Speed Assist is uncertain that an acquired speed limit is accurate, the touchscreen may not display a speed limit sign and warnings do not take effect.

NOTE: Speed limit warnings go away after ten seconds, or when Cybertruck slows down below the specified limit.

> WARNING: Do not rely on Speed Assist to determine the appropriate speed limit or driving speed. Always drive at a safe speed based on traffic and road conditions.

## Controlling Speed Assist

To adjust the Speed Limit Warning setting, touch Controls > Autopilot > Speed Limit Warning, then choose one of these options:

- Off - Speed limit warnings do not display and chimes are not sounded.
- Display - Speed limit signs display on the and the sign increases in size when you exceed the determined limit.
- Chime - In addition to the visual display, a chime is sounded when you exceed the determined speed limit.

You can also specify how the speed limit is determined:

- Relative - You can set a speed limit offset (+ or -) if you want to be alerted only when you exceed the offset speed limit by a specified amount. For example, you can increase the offset to +10 mph (10 km/h) if you only want to be warned when you exceed the speed limit by 10 mph (10 km/h).
- Absolute - Manually specify any speed limit between 20 and 140 mph (30 and 240 km/h).

NOTE: Speed Assist is not always accurate. In some situations, the location of a road can be miscalculated and Speed Assist can display a speed for a directly adjacent road that may have a different speed limit. For example, Speed Assist can assume Cybertruck is on a controlled-access highway when it is actually on a nearby surface street, and vice versa.

NOTE: Your chosen setting is retained until you manually change it.

## Limitations and Inaccuracies

Speed Assist may not be fully functional or may provide inaccurate information in these situations:

- Visibility is poor and speed limit signs are not clearly visible (due to heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.).
- Bright light (such as from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight) is interfering with the view of the camera(s).
- Cybertruck is being driven very close to a vehicle in front of it which is blocking the view of the camera(s).
- The windshield is obstructing the view of the camera(s) (fogged over, dirty, covered by a sticker, etc.).
- Speed limit signs are concealed by objects.
- The speed limits stored in the map database are incorrect or outdated.
- Cybertruck is being driven in an area where GPS or map data is not available or where speed limit signs can not be detected.
- Traffic signs that do not conform to standard recognizable formats, such as digital or temporary speed signs.
- A road or a speed limit has recently changed.

> WARNING: The list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of Speed Assist. Speed Assist may fail to provide warnings for many other reasons.

# Safety & Security Settings

## About the Security System

The vehicle security system activates when Cybertruck does not detect an authenticated phone or key and:

- A locked door is opened
- The locked tailgate is opened
- The powered front trunk is opened

When your vehicle detects this, the siren sounds, headlights and turn signals flash, and you receive a notification on your mobile app that the security alarm is triggered. To deactivate the alarm, press any button on the mobile app or tap your key card against the card reader located on the driver's side door pillar.

To enable the alarm system, touch Controls > Safety > Security Alarm. When enabled, Cybertruck activates its alarm under these conditions:

- One minute after you exit.
- The doors are locked.
- A recognized key is no longer detected.

The tailgate does not need to be closed for Cybertruck to activate the alarm.

Sentry Mode and the vehicle alarm system are two separate things: the alarm system works similar to other vehicles (a siren sounds when a locked door is opened), whereas Sentry Mode uses cameras and audio to detect suspicious activity nearby (see Sentry Mode on page 151 for more information). If Cybertruck is in Sentry Mode, the Security Alarm setting is not available.

## Parental Controls

Parental controls enable you to limit the capabilities of Cybertruck and ensure that safety settings are enabled and cannot be changed.

NOTE: You can also access parental controls from the Tesla mobile app (version 4.34.5 or higher required).

NOTE: You cannot enable Parental Controls if Speed Limit Mode is enabled.

When you enable Require Safety Features, Cybertruck enables or configures these vehicle settings:

NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be equipped with the listed features.

- Automatic Emergency Braking
- Obstacle-Aware Acceleration
- Automatic Blind Spot Camera
- Blind Spot Collision Warning Chime
- Automatic 911 Call
- Allow Mobile Access
- Lane Departure Avoidance: Set to Assist.
- Speed Limit Warning: Set to Chime.
- Forward Collision Warning: Set to Early.

If you want to enable parental controls:

1. With your vehicle in Park, touch Controls > Safety > Parental Controls on the touchscreen.
2. Enable or configure the parental controls you want to use:
   - Limit Speed: Caps the speed at which Cybertruck can drive.
   - Reduce Acceleration: Limits the vehicle Acceleration to Chill.
   - Require Safety Features: Enables various safety features in the vehicle (if equipped). Drivers cannot change these settings while parental controls are active.
   - Send Curfew Notifications: Turns on curfew notifications from 11 PM to 4 AM. When someone shifts the vehicle to Drive after the start of curfew, a notification is sent through the Tesla mobile app to all phone keys paired with the vehicle, notifying users that Cybertruck is in use.
3. Touch Confirm.
4. Enter a PIN.

NOTE: Drivers must re-enter the PIN from Parental Controls to disable the restrictions. Touch Driver Profile > Parental Controls to re-enter the PIN.

## PIN to Drive

For an added layer of security, prevent Cybertruck from being driven until a 4-digit PIN (Personal Identification Number) is entered. To enable this setting, touch Controls > Safety > PIN to Drive and follow the on-screen prompts to create a driving PIN.

When enabled, in addition to entering the 4-digit driving PIN to drive, you must also use it to enter Valet mode for the first time and create the 4-digit valet PIN to enter and exit Valet mode. In Valet mode, Cybertruck can be driven without the need for the valet to enter a driving PIN. The PIN to Drive setting is disabled whenever Valet mode is active.

If you forget your driving PIN, touch the link to enter your Tesla login credentials on the PIN to Drive popup, then follow the instructions on the touchscreen.

NOTE: In the unlikely event that your touchscreen is unresponsive, you may be unable to enter the PIN. In this case, first try to restart the touchscreen (see Restarting the Touchscreen on page 10). If the touchscreen is still unresponsive, you can still bypass PIN to Drive by turning on Keyless Driving in the Tesla mobile app.

# Safety & Security Settings

## Glovebox PIN

Protect the contents in your glovebox with a 4-digit PIN (not related to PIN to Drive). To enable, touch Controls > Safety > Glovebox PIN and follow the directions on the touchscreen. When enabled, you are prompted to enter the PIN to open the glovebox. Select the toggle to disable and then enter the PIN to remove this added security protection.

If you forget your glovebox PIN, reset it by entering your Tesla login credentials, then follow the directions on the touchscreen.

NOTE: Using a Glovebox PIN allows the glovebox to be opened even when Cybertruck is in Valet mode.

## Speed Limit Mode

Speed Limit Mode allows you to limit acceleration and maximum driving speed to a chosen value between 50 and 120 mph (80 and 193 km/h). The first time you use this feature, you must create a 4-digit PIN that you must use to enable and disable Speed Limit Mode. When enabled and the driving speed approaches within approximately 3 mph (5 km/h) of the maximum speed, a chime sounds, the touchscreen displays a message, and Cybertruck sends a notification to the mobile app. You can also touch Security > Speed Limit Mode to enable from the Tesla mobile app. To enable Speed Limit Mode:

1. Ensure Cybertruck is in Park.
2. Touch Controls > Safety > Speed Limit Mode on the touchscreen.
3. Select the maximum driving speed.
4. Drag the slider to the On position.
5. Enter the 4-digit PIN that you want to use to enable and disable Speed Limit Mode.

NOTE: If you forget the PIN, you can disable Speed Limit Mode by entering login credentials for your Tesla account.

NOTE: While Speed Limit Mode is enabled, the acceleration setting automatically sets to Chill.

⚠️ WARNING: Driving downhill can increase driving speed and cause Cybertruck to exceed your chosen maximum speed.

⚠️ WARNING: Speed Limit Mode is not a replacement for good judgment, driver training, and the need to closely monitor speed limits and driving conditions. Accidents occur at any speed and it is your responsibility to drive safely.

## Trailer Alarm

When enabled, Cybertruck sounds an alarm if the vehicle detects the trailer is being unplugged while Trailer Mode is active and the vehicle is locked.

## Clear Browser Data

You can clear your vehicle's browser data (like you would on a computer or smartphone) by navigating to Controls > Service > Clear Browser Data. This is useful for many situations, such erasing settings or searches from another driver.

Check the boxes on the touchscreen popup to exclude bookmarks and/or history for your convenience.

# Dashcam

NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be equipped with Dashcam or the features may not operate exactly as described. It is your sole responsibility to consult and comply with all local regulations and property restrictions regarding the use of cameras.

Dashcam records video footage of your vehicle's surroundings while driving. Use Dashcam to record driving incidents or other notable events, like you would for an external dashcam on other vehicles.

The Dashcam icon is located in the app launcher. You can add the Dashcam app to the bottom bar for easy access (see Customizing My Apps on page 12). When Cybertruck is in Park, touching the Dashcam icon displays the Viewer (see Viewing Video Recordings on page 153).

To protect your privacy, video recordings are saved locally to a formatted USB flash drive's onboard memory. Recordings are not sent to Tesla. Cybertruck does not record videos when Dashcam is Off.

## How to Use Dashcam

1. Format a USB flash drive. Dashcam requires a properly formatted USB drive inserted in your vehicle's USB port to store and retrieve footage. There are two ways to format the flash drive if needed:
   - Format the flash drive with Cybertruck. Insert the flash drive into the USB port and navigate to Controls > Safety > Format USB Drive.
   - Format the flash drive on a computer. See USB Drive Requirements for Recording Videos on page 153 for more information.

2. Insert the USB flash drive into your vehicle's USB port, preferably the one in the glovebox.

3. Enable Dashcam by touching Controls > Dashcam. Dashcam allows you to choose how and when footage is saved. You can choose between:
   - Auto: Dashcam automatically saves a recording to the USB drive when Cybertruck detects a safety-critical event, such as a collision or airbag deployment. When Auto is selected, detection can vary and is subject to your vehicle's power, sleep, and Autopilot state.
     NOTE: Several factors determine whether Dashcam automatically saves a recording of a safety-critical event (for example, amount of force, whether or not airbags deploy, etc.). Do not rely on Dashcam to automatically record all safety-critical events.
   - Manual: You must manually touch the Dashcam icon to save a recording of the most recent ten minutes of footage.
   - On Honk: When you press the horn, Dashcam saves a recording of the most recent ten minutes of footage. You can enable this along with Auto or Manual simultaneously.

4. Once enabled, the Dashcam icon indicates when footage is saved. You can also view the status of the Dashcam icon in Controls:

   The icon changes to show the status of Dashcam:

   | Icon | Status |
   |------|--------|
   | Recording icon | RECORDING: Dashcam is recording. To save video footage, touch the icon. To pause recording, press and hold the icon. |
   | Available icon | AVAILABLE: Dashcam is available but not actively recording. Touch the dashcam icon to start recording footage. |
   | Paused icon | PAUSED: Dashcam is on, but not currently recording or saving anything. This may happen while the viewer is launched, for example. |
   | Busy icon | BUSY: Dashcam is in the process of loading, saving, or overwriting footage. While dashcam is busy, footage is not being captured and recorded. |
   | Saved icon | SAVED: Footage is saved. You can also save Dashcam clips by touching the Dashcam icon in the app launcher while Driving. |

5. When your desired footage is saved, view the clips on the touchscreen or a computer:
   - Touchscreen: Ensure Cybertruck is in Park and touch the Dashcam icon in the app launcher. Videos are organized by timestamp. See Viewing Video Recordings on page 153 for more information.
   - Computer: Insert the USB flash drive into a computer and navigate to the TeslaCam folder. Videos are organized by timestamp. See Viewing Video Recordings on page 153 for more information.

6. To turn Dashcam off, navigate to Controls > Dash cam > Off. If set to Auto, Manual, or On Honk, Dashcam automatically enables (but may not be actively saving footage, depending on your preferences) every time you drive.

# Sentry Mode

NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be equipped with Sentry Mode or the features may not operate exactly as described. It is your sole responsibility to consult and comply with all local regulations and property restrictions regarding the use of cameras.

When enabled, your vehicle's cameras remain powered on and ready to record suspicious activity around your vehicle when Cybertruck is locked and in Park. Think of Sentry Mode as an intelligent vehicle security system that alerts you when it detects possible threats nearby.

If a threat is detected or the vehicle sensors determine there is a lot of jerky movement like when getting towed or shaken, Sentry Mode:

- Pulses the headlights.
- Sounds the alarm.
- Displays a message on the touchscreen that indicates cameras may be recording to inform individuals outside of the vehicles.
- Alerts you of the alarm on the mobile app.
- Saves footage of the event to a USB drive (if installed).

Sentry Mode is disabled by default. You can use voice commands or the Tesla mobile app to easily enable or disable Sentry Mode. To enable Sentry Mode using voice commands, say "Keep Tesla safe," "Keep my car safe," "Sentry on," or "Enable Sentry" (see Voice Commands on page 25).

Sentry Mode requires your Battery to be at least 20% charged. If the Battery falls below 20%, Sentry Mode turns off and the mobile app sends you a notification. Power consumption may increase when Sentry Mode is active.

NOTE: When Sentry Mode is enabled, the Security Alarm settings (Controls > Safety > Security Alarm) are not available.

⚠️ CAUTION: Do not rely on Sentry Mode to protect Cybertruck from all possible security threats. Sentry Mode uses many factors to determine whether to activate the security alarm. All impacts may not be detected and the alarm may not activate in all situations. While it may help deter some threats, no security system can prevent all attacks.

NOTE: Sentry Mode only sends notifications to the mobile app when the alarm is triggered or sudden jerky motions are detected by the vehicle. If Sentry Mode doesn't consider an event a clear threat, the vehicle records footage but doesn't trigger the alarm.

## How to Use Sentry Mode (With a USB Flash Drive)

1. Sentry Mode requires a properly formatted USB drive inserted in your vehicle's USB port. There are two ways to format the USB drive:

   - Insert the USB drive into the USB port and navigate to Controls > Format USB Drive. Your vehicle automatically formats the USB drive for you.
   - Format the USB drive on a computer. See USB Drive Requirements for Recording Videos on page 153 for more information.

2. Insert the USB drive into the vehicle's USB port, preferrable the one in the glove box.

3. With your vehicle in Park, enable Dashcam by navigating to Controls > Safety > Dashcam (Dashcam must be enabled for Sentry Mode to work).

4. Touch Controls > Sentry Mode > On. Once enabled, the Sentry Mode icon turns red.

   [Image of a red circular icon]

   When enabled, Sentry Mode is idle, ready to sound the alarm and save a recording of the security event if triggered. See Viewing Video Recordings on page 153 for information on viewing footage.

5. To silence the security alarm and audio system when the alarm is triggered, navigate to Controls > Safety > Disable Sentry Sounds. When enabled, Sentry Mode still sends a notification through the mobile app and saves the last 10 minutes footage.

6. To manually enable/disable Sentry Mode until the next drive, touch the Sentry Mode icon. Sentry Mode is Off when the icon is no longer red.

   [Image of a grey circular icon]

Turn Sentry Mode Off in Controls > Safety > Sentry Mode to disable for more than one drive cycle.

## How to Use Sentry Mode (Without a USB Flash Drive)

When Sentry mode is enabled and a security event is detected but without a USB drive plugged into a USB port, your vehicle alerts you through the mobile app, without any camera recordings.

## Sentry Mode Settings

- Exclude specific locations

  In Controls > Safety > Sentry Mode, you can determine if you want Sentry Mode to not enable in certain locations (see Home, Work, and Favorite Destinations on page 165 for more information):

# USB Drive Requirements for Recording Videos

Some features require you to use a USB drive (for example, Dashcam, Sentry Mode) that meet these requirements:

- Minimum storage capacity of 64 GB. Use a USB drive with as much available storage as possible. Video footage can occupy a large amount of space.
- A sustained write speed of at least 4 MB/s. Note that sustained write speed differs from peak write speed.
- USB 2.0 compatible. If using a USB 3.0 drive, it must also support USB 2.0.
- Properly formatted (either automatically or manually on page 153).

When the USB drive runs out of storage space, video footage can no longer be saved. To prevent the USB drive from getting full, regularly move saved videos to another device and delete them from the USB drive.

When enabled, Dashcam and Sentry Mode records footage in cycles. Footage is continuously overwritten unless you save it. You must save your desired footage to view it, otherwise the footage is erased and overwritten. See Sentry Mode on page 151 and Dashcam on page 150 for information on saving footage. Four videos are recorded for each saved clip, one from each camera (front, rear, left, and right).

NOTE: In some market regions you can purchase recommended USB drives on http://www.tesla.com.

## Automatically Formatting a USB Drive

Insert the USB drive into a front USB port that supports the ability to format, save, and view video footage (see Interior Electronics on page 20). Then, touch Controls > Safety > Format USB Drive. This automatically formats the USB drive as exFAT and creates folders for TeslaCam. The USB drive is now ready to record and save video footage.

Format USB Drive is available only when a USB drive (with one or fewer partitions) is inserted into a front USB port. Choosing Format USB Drive erases any existing content on the USB drive. Before using this feature, move any content you want to keep to a different device.

## Manually Formatting a USB Drive

If Cybertruck is unable to format the USB drive, format it using a computer:

1. Format the USB drive as exFAT, MS-DOS FAT (for Mac), ext3, or ext4 (NTFS is currently not supported).
2. Create a base-level folder titled TeslaCam. You can use one USB drive for Dashcam, Sentry Mode, and audio files, but you must create separate partitions or folders on the exFAT USB drive.
3. Once formatted, insert the USB drive into the glovebox USB port (if equipped), otherwise use a front USB port in the center console. Do not use a rear USB port because they can only charge devices. It may take a few seconds for Cybertruck to recognize the USB drive.
4. Once recognized, ensure icons for Dashcam and Sentry Mode are available when you touch Controls. Cybertruck is now ready to record videos.

NOTE: You may need to first enable Sentry Mode (if equipped) by touching Controls > Sentry.

## Viewing Video Recordings

If footage is saved, you can view the clips on the touchscreen or a computer.

### Viewing on the Touchscreen

You can view recorded footage on the touchscreen when Cybertruck is in Park. Touch the Dashcam icon located in the app launcher. The tabs display a list of all video clips, organized by location and timestamp. Pause, rewind, fast forward, and delete clips as needed. Swipe to the right or press and hold to quickly delete certain clips.

Navigate to Controls > Safety > Delete Dashcam Clips to delete all Dashcam and Sentry Mode footage.

NOTE: Dashcam recording pauses when you launch the Viewer.

### Viewing on a Computer

Insert the USB drive into a computer and navigate to the TeslaCam folder.

The TeslaCam folder contains these sub-folders:

- RecentClips: Contains up to 60 minutes of recorded content.
- SavedClips: Contains all recordings that are saved and renamed from the RecentClips folder.
- SentryClips: Contains recordings from all Sentry Mode security events. If storage space on the USB drive becomes limited, the oldest Sentry Clips are deleted to provide space for new ones. Once deleted, you cannot retrieve them.

# Operating Climate Controls

## Overview of Climate Controls

Climate controls are available at the bottom of the touchscreen. By default, climate control is set to Auto, which maintains optimum comfort in all but the most severe weather conditions. When you adjust the cabin temperature while in Auto, the system automatically adjusts the heating, air conditioning, air distribution, and fan speed to maintain the cabin at your selected temperature.

Touch the displayed temperature at the bottom of the touchscreen to access the main climate controls screen, where you can adjust your climate preferences. You can return to Auto at any time by touching Auto. Touch the power button on the main climate controls screen to toggle on or off. For quick access to common controls, touch the temperature at the bottom of the screen to display the climate popup.

The touchscreen may display Warming Up or Cooling Down while getting to your preferred temperature. You may hear the fan speed increase or decrease during this time.

NOTE: The climate control system is powered by the high voltage Battery. Therefore, prolonged use decreases driving range.

WARNING: To avoid burns resulting from prolonged use, individuals who have peripheral neuropathy, or whose capacity to feel pain is limited because of diabetes, age, neurological injury, or some other condition, should exercise caution when using the climate control system and seat heaters.

## Adjusting Climate Control Settings

Easily adjust your climate preferences, such as turning on the seat heater or changing the cabin temperature, hands-free by using voice commands (see Voice Commands on page 25). You can use the climate controls to customize temperature and fan, defrost windows, heat seats, and more.

NOTE: For one-touch access to seat heaters and defrosters, you can add these controls to My Apps. See Customizing My Apps on page 12.

# Operating Climate Controls

NOTE: Because Cybertruck runs much quieter than a gasoline-powered vehicle, you may notice the sound of the air conditioning compressor as it is operating. To minimize noise, reduce the fan speed.

Control the flow of air inside the cabin. Air can be drawn into Cybertruck from outside or air can be recirculated inside the cabin.

Adjust the fan speed using the slider. When in Auto, the fan speed levels change to Low/ Medium/ High.

NOTE: Adjusting the fan speed may change the selected setting for how air is drawn into Cybertruck in order to increase or reduce air flow.

AUTO Adjust climate settings for the front and rear cabin. If Auto is enabled and a passenger is detected, the set temperature is maintained for the rear cabin.

Choose where air flows into the front cabin (windshield, face-level, or foot-level vents). You can choose one or more vents.

Touch the driver's, or passenger's, side seat icon to adjust seat heaters for the driver. The seat operates at three levels from 3 (highest) to 1 (lowest). The seat icon displays twisting lines that turn red (heating) or blue (cooling) corresponding with the set level. Auto, which displays when the climate control system is set to Auto, warms or cools the front seats based on cabin temperature. For one-touch access to seat heaters, you can add them to the touchscreen's bottom bar (see Customizing My Apps on page 12).

Adjust the heated steering wheel. The icon displays red twisting lines that correspond to the set level. If set to Auto, the steering wheel is heated as needed, based on cabin temperature, whenever the climate control system is set to Auto. For one-touch access, you can add this control to the touchscreen's bottom bar (see Customizing My Apps on page 12).

Turn on the wiper defroster.

When in Park, Keep Climate On, Dog, and Camp allow you to keep the climate control system operating, even when you leave Cybertruck (see Keep Climate On, Dog, and Camp on page 157).

# Operating Climate Controls

## Climate Popup

Touch the temperature arrows on the bottom of the touchscreen to display a popup for easy access to some of the most common climate controls:

NOTE: For one-touch access to seat heaters and defrosters, you can add these controls to My Apps. See Customizing My Apps on page 12.

- Touch to access the main climate controls screen.
- Enable or disable heated or cooled seats (if equipped).
- Enable or disable the front or rear windshield defrosters.
- Modify the cabin temperature by dragging the slider. You can also enable temperature splitting which allows the driver and front passenger to customize their own climate preferences. The front passenger can touch the temperature icon on the bottom of the touchscreen or the main climate controls screen to adjust. Touch Split again to disable climate splitting.

## Keep Climate On, Dog, and Camp

These settings allow you to keep the climate control system running when in Park, whether you stay inside of, or leave, your vehicle. These settings are useful when it is important to maintain the cabin temperature in hot or cold weather conditions.

Keep Climate On: Maintains the climate control system on at a desire temperature. For example, when leaving groceries in Cybertruck on hot days, you may want to use Keep Climate On to pre-condition the cabin to maintain a particular temperature.

Dog: Keeps the cabin at a comfortable temperature for your pet while you actively and frequently monitor this temperature using the mobile app (which requires both your phone and the vehicle to have cellular connectivity plenty of battery). When in Dog, the touchscreen displays the current cabin temperature to inform people passing by that your pet is safe. This setting is not intended for people, and should only be used for short periods of time while you stay in close proximity should you need to return to the vehicle in situations where the temperature can no longer be maintained.

NOTE: To avoid accidentally pressing the window switch (such as your dog stepping on it), the windows cannot be rolled down while Dog is enabled.

NOTE: If Dog and Sentry are enabled at the same time, Sentry defaults to Disable Sentry Sounds to protect your pet. The cabin camera shows the inside of the vehicle so you can check on your pet at any time. See Sentry Mode on page 151 for more information.

Camp: Allows you to power electronics through the USB ports and low voltage outlets and maintain the cabin temperature. The touchscreen remains on so you can play music, browse the internet, play games, or watch shows in Tesla Theater. You can also control media and climate settings from a paired phone. Camp is ideal for remaining inside your vehicle, such as camping or staying with a child. While active, Sentry Mode and the vehicle alarm system are disabled. Walk-Away Door Lock is inactive.

To operate Keep Climate On, Dog, or Camp:

1. Make sure the Battery's charge level is at least 20%.
2. Engage Park. These settings are available only when Cybertruck is in Park.
3. Adjust the climate settings.
4. On the climate controls screen, touch Keep Climate On, Dog, or Camp.

NOTE: You can also control Dog and Camp from the mobile app by swiping up from the gray bar on the Climate screen.

The climate control system attempts to maintain your climate settings until you shift out of Park or manually turn it off. Avoid using these features when the Battery's charge level is low or on extremely hot days.

Dog cannot be enabled if the cabin temperature is too hot, or if the vehicle detects an issue with the climate control system. Ensure that the cabin temperature is at a safe and comfortable level before enabling Dog.

If Keep Climate On, Dog, or Camp are on, the Tesla mobile app attempts to repeatedly send notifications reminding you to check on anything that you have left in Cybertruck if:

- The Battery's charge level drops below 20%.
- The vehicle detects an issue with the climate control system.
- The cabin temperature changes significantly from the level initially set for Dog.

NOTE: Software updates cannot be performed when Keep Climate On, Dog, or Camp is active.

⚠️ WARNING: Never leave a child unattended in your vehicle.

⚠️ WARNING: Check local laws for any restrictions on leaving pets unattended in your vehicle.

⚠️ WARNING: You are responsible for the safety of your dog or pet. Never leave them in Cybertruck for long periods of time. Constantly monitor the vehicle temperature and their well-being. Make sure you have sufficient cellular coverage on your phone and time to return to the vehicle, if necessary.

⚠️ WARNING: In the unlikely event that your climate control system needs service or is not working as expected, avoid using Keep Climate On, Dog, and Camp. Never rely on your vehicle to protect something irreplaceable.

Climate                                                                157

# Operating Climate Controls

WARNING: You can adjust and monitor the climate control system remotely using the mobile app. However, if you use the mobile app to turn off the climate control system, Keep Climate On, Dog, and Camp stop operating.

- When you use the mobile app to turn on the climate control system, it automatically turns off when the charge level drops to 20%, or if two hours has passed. To cool or heat the cabin for a longer period of time, charge the vehicle and re-enable your climate control preference through the mobile app.

## Cabin Overheat Protection

Cabin Overheat Protection prevents the cabin from getting too hot in scorching ambient conditions. While not necessary to activate whenever you leave Cybertruck, the climate control system can reduce and maintain the temperature of your vehicle's cabin. This can prevent the cabin from getting too hot after leaving it parked in the sun, making the vehicle more comfortable when you return. Cabin Overheat Protection may take up to 15 minutes to enable once you exit the vehicle. This feature is intended for passenger comfort and has no impact on the reliability of your vehicle's components.

To turn on, touch Controls > Safety > Cabin Overheat Protection and choose:

- On: The air conditioning operates when the cabin temperature exceeds 105° F (40° C), or the selected temperature on the touchscreen or mobile app. Customizing temperatures may require the most recent version of the mobile app.
- Off: Disables Cabin Overheat Protection.

You can also enable Cabin Overheat Protection remotely through the mobile app by touching Climate. Swipe up on the bottom menu and select a setting under Cabin Overheat Protection (see Mobile App on page 64).

Cabin Overheat Protection operates until 12 hours has elapsed once you exit Cybertruck, or until the Battery energy drops below 20%, whichever comes first. Using Cabin Overheat Protection requires energy from the Battery, which may decrease range.

WARNING: Due to automatic shut-off, extreme outside conditions, or other potential inability to maintain the selected temperature, the inside of the vehicle can become dangerously hot, even when Cabin Overheat Protection is enabled. If you experience temperatures exceeding the selected temperature repeatedly, contact Tesla service.

WARNING: Never leave children or pets in the vehicle unattended. Due to automatic shut-off or extreme outside conditions, the inside of the vehicle can become dangerously hot, even when Cabin Overheat Protection is enabled.

## Climate Control Operating Tips

Normal behavior:

- To reduce the temperature in the cabin in hot weather conditions, the fan may turn on to vent the cabin when the vehicle is parked. This occurs only if the Battery's charge level is above 20%.

- In addition to cooling the interior, the air conditioning compressor also cools the Battery. Therefore, in hot weather, the air conditioning compressor can turn on even if you turned it off. This is normal because the system's priority is to cool the Battery to ensure it stays within an optimum temperature range to support longevity and optimum performance.

- Even when not in use, you may hear Cybertruck emit a whining noise or the sound of water circulating. These sounds are normal and occur when the internal cooling systems turn on to support various vehicle functions, such as maintaining the low voltage battery and balancing the temperature of the high voltage Battery.

- In very humid conditions, it is normal for the windshield to fog slightly when you first turn on the air conditioning.

- It is normal for a small pool of water to form under Cybertruck when parked. Extra water produced by the dehumidifying process is drained underneath.

Tips:

- If the climate control system is louder than you prefer, manually reduce the fan speed.

- Improve the efficiency of the cabin heating or cooling by reducing your rate of acceleration. This allows the heat pump system to take more heat from the Battery to efficiently heat the cabin, instead of maintaining the Battery's ability to provide peak acceleration performance. Note that when subsequently increasing the acceleration mode, the Battery requires time to warm up before the increased level of acceleration is available.

- To ensure the climate control system operates efficiently, close all windows and ensure that the exterior grille in front of the windshield is free of ice, snow, leaves, and other debris.

- Your charge port latch may freeze in extremely cold weather or icy conditions. In cases where you cannot remove or insert the charge cable, or your vehicle is not Supercharging due to the latch being frozen in place, enable Defrost Truck in the mobile app. This helps thaw ice on the charge port latch so the charge cable can be removed or inserted. See Cold Weather Best Practices on page 160 for more information.

# Adjusting the Front and Rear Vents

Cybertruck has a unique horizontal face-level vent that spans the width of the dashboard. It also has vents at the top and bottom of the rear console.

NOTE: Outside air is drawn into Cybertruck through the grill in front of the windshield. Keep the grill clear of obstructions, such as leaves and snow.

Using the front and rear touchscreens, you can pinpoint exactly where you want to direct the air flowing from this vent when heating or cooling the cabin. When the face-level vent is on you can adjust the direction of the air flow from each vent. To adjust the direction of the air flow, touch the radiating air waves from the corresponding vent on the touchscreen. The air flows in a single stream when centered or splits into mirrored air streams when air is directed outward or inward from the center of the vent.

NOTE: When you split a vent into two separate air flows, the air flow in each direction is not as strong as when all air is flowing in a single direction.

Front passengers can turn off the flow of air from the passenger vent. To turn off air flow, press and hold the front passenger air waves on the touchscreen. You can turn on the flow of air again by touching the front passenger vent.

## Cabin Air Filter(s)

Cybertruck has a HEPA filter to prevent pollen, industrial fallout, road dust and other particles from entering through the vents.

NOTE: The HEPA filter requires periodic replacement. See Service Intervals on page 189.

Climate                                                                                                                              159

# Cold Weather Best Practices

To ensure that Cybertruck provides you with the best ownership experience possible in harsh cold weather conditions, follow these best practices.

## Before Driving

When snow and ice accumulate on your vehicle, moving parts, such as the doors, windows, mirrors, and the wiper can freeze in place. To achieve maximum range and performance, it is helpful to warm the cabin and Battery before driving. There are several ways to do so:

- Touch Controls > Schedule (also available on both the charging and climate control screens) to set a time when you want your vehicle to be ready to drive (see Scheduled Precondition and Charge on page 181).
- In the mobile app, navigate to Climate to customize the temperature at which you want to heat the cabin. This also warms the high voltage Battery as needed.
- In the mobile app, navigate to Climate to melt snow, ice, and frost on the windshield, charge port, windows, and mirrors. This also warms the high voltage Battery as needed.

NOTE: Tesla recommends activating climate settings at least 30-45 minutes before departure (see Operating Climate Controls on page 154). Preconditioning times depend on outside temperature and other factors. The mobile app will notify you once your vehicle has reached the desired preconditioning temperature.

## Charge Port

If your charge port latch freezes in place and a charging cable becomes stuck in the charge port, try manually releasing the charge cable. See Manually Releasing Charge Cable on page 179.

You can also prevent the occurrence of a charge port latch freezing in place by using the Schedule settings (see Scheduled Precondition and Charge on page 181).

NOTE: If your charge port latch is frozen in place, it may not lock the charging cable in place when inserted, but it can still charge at a slow AC rate even if the latch is not engaged.

## Charging

By using Trip Planner to navigate to a Tesla charging location, Cybertruck pre-heats the high voltage Battery to ensure when you arrive at the charger, the temperature of the Battery is optimal and ready to charge. This reduces the amount of time it takes to charge. See (see Trip Planner on page 167).

NOTE: Tesla recommends using Trip Planner to navigate to a charging location for at least 30-45 minutes before arrival to ensure optimal Battery temperature and charging conditions. If the drive to the charging location is less than 30-45 minutes, consider preconditioning the Battery before driving (see Before Driving on page 160).

## Windows

In the mobile app, go to Climate and select Defrost Truck, which helps melt snow, ice, and frost on the windshield, windows, and mirrors.

Use the mobile app to schedule a service appointment for Tesla to provide hydrophobic coating to the side and rear windows (not the front windshield) for a nominal fee.

## Mirrors

If ice buildup is expected when parking, turn off Auto-Fold Mirrors. Touch Controls > Auto-Fold. Ice can prevent exterior side mirrors from folding or unfolding.

NOTE: Side mirrors automatically heat as needed during preconditioning, or when the rear defroster is turned on.

## Tires and Tire Chains

Use winter tires to increase traction in snowy or icy conditions. You can purchase winter tires on the Tesla Shop (see Seasonal Tire Types on page 198).

Tire chains provide additional traction when driving in snowy or icy conditions. Check local regulations to determine if tire chains are recommended or required during winter months. See Tire Chains on page 199 for more information.

Your vehicle's tire pressures will drop in cold ambient temperatures. If the TPMS indicator light appears, inflate the tires before driving. The tires will lose one PSI for every 10° F (6° C) drop in outside temperature (see Inspecting and Maintaining Tires on page 197). Proper tire pressures help protect tires from potholes and improve range when properly inflated.

## While Driving

Cold weather can increase energy consumption because more power is required for driving, cabin and Battery heating. Follow these suggestions to reduce energy consumption:

- Use seat heaters to keep warm. Seat heaters use less energy than the cabin heater. Lowering the cabin temperature and using seat heaters reduces energy consumption (see Operating Climate Controls on page 154).
- Slow down your driving and avoid frequent and rapid acceleration.
---
# Cold Weather Best Practices

## Regenerative Braking

Regenerative braking can be limited if the Battery is too cold. As you continue to drive, the Battery warms up and regenerative power increases (see Regenerative Braking on page 87).

NOTE: Limited regenerative braking can be avoided if you allow enough time to precondition your vehicle or if you use Schedule to precondition Cybertruck before your departure time (see Scheduled Precondition and Charge on page 181).

## Cold Battery

A blue snowflake icon appears on your touchscreen when some of the stored energy in the Battery is unavailable because the Battery is cold. This portion of unavailable energy displays in blue on the Battery meter. Regenerative braking, acceleration, and charging rates may be limited. The snowflake icon no longer displays when the Battery is sufficiently warm.

## After Driving

Leave Cybertruck plugged in when not in use. This uses the charging system, rather than the Battery itself, to keep the Battery warm (see High Voltage Battery Information on page 175).

## Scheduled Precondition

When parked, use the Controls > Schedule settings, available on both the charging and climate control screens, to set a time when you want to precondition Cybertruck (see Scheduled Precondition and Charge on page 181). You can also use Schedule to prevent the charge port latch freezing in place. Your vehicle determines the appropriate time to begin preconditioning so that cabin and Battery are warm by your planned departure time.

Tesla recommends that you also schedule a charge with your precondition to ensure that your vehicle has sufficient energy for the trip. When Cybertruck is not plugged in, preconditioning operates but only when the Battery's charge level is above 20%.

## Storage

If you leave Cybertruck parked for an extended period of time, plug the vehicle into a charger to prevent normal range loss and to keep the Battery at an optimal temperature. Your vehicle is safe to stay plugged in for any length of time.

When not in use, Cybertruck enters a sleep mode to conserve energy. Reduce the number of times you check your vehicle's status on the mobile app, as this automatically wakes up your vehicle and starts normal energy consumption.

# Hot Weather Best Practices

To ensure that Cybertruck provides you with the best ownership experience possible in hot ambient conditions, follow these best practices.

## Before Driving

There are several ways to prepare your vehicle for a drive, without having to get into an already hot vehicle:

- Precondition the cabin by moving the direction of air flow from the vents, and turn the seat heaters on or off. In the mobile app, navigate to Climate to customize the temperature at which you want to cool the cabin.

- Touch Schedule, available on both the Charging and Climate Control screens, to set a time when you want your vehicle to be ready to drive (see Scheduled Precondition and Charge on page 181).

- Enable Cabin Overheat Protection, which prevents the cabin from getting too warm in hot ambient conditions.

- In the mobile app, navigate to Controls to vent the windows.

NOTE: Tesla recommends activating climate settings at least 30-45 minutes before departure (see Operating Climate Controls on page 154). Preconditioning times depend on outside temperature and other factors. The mobile app will notify you once your vehicle has reached the desired preconditioning temperature.

## After Driving

Leave Cybertruck plugged in when not in use, especially if using Preconditioning or Cabin Overheat Protection. This uses the charging system, rather than the battery itself, to maintain a comfortable temperature (see High Voltage Battery Information on page 175). In addition, there are several ways to minimize a hot cabin:

- Before leaving your vehicle (to run errands, for example), use Dog Mode to keep the cabin cool for pets or perishable goods. See Keep Climate On, Dog, and Camp on page 157 for more information.

- Tesla recommends turning the air conditioning off approximately 30 seconds before pressing Park to reduce puddling below the vehicle.

- Park in the shade to help reduce power consumption and maintain cooler cabin temperatures.

- Use a sun shade if you have to park outside in the sun.

- When parked, plug in Cybertruck and Schedule your charging. Your vehicle determines the appropriate time to begin charging so it is complete during off-peak hours. The cabin and Battery are also prepared by your set departure time. For more information, see Scheduled Precondition and Charge on page 181.

## Charging

When using Trip Planner or navigating to a Supercharger station, your vehicle automatically prepares the Battery for most efficient charging. In extreme heat, you may not see the message that the vehicle is preconditioning the Battery while navigating to a Supercharger, but it is still preparing the Battery for charging.

NOTE: Tesla recommends using Trip Planner to navigate to a charging location for at least 30-45 minutes before arrival to ensure optimal Battery temperature and charging conditions. If the drive to the charging location is less than 30-45 minutes, consider preconditioning the Battery before driving (see Before Driving on page 160).

If possible, leave your vehicle plugged into a charger whenever not in use, even in warm weather, especially if using Preconditioning or Cabin Overheat Protection.

## Storage

If you leave Cybertruck parked for an extended period of time, plug the vehicle into a charger to prevent normal range loss and to keep the Battery at an optimal temperature. Your vehicle is safe to stay plugged in for any length of time.

When not in use, Cybertruck enters a sleep mode to conserve energy. Reduce the number of times you check your vehicle's status on the mobile app, as this automatically wakes up your vehicle and starts normal energy consumption.

- Touch the arrow icon to navigate to the charging location.

NOTE: When navigating to a Supercharger (or third-party fast charger in some regions), Cybertruck preconditions the Battery to prepare for charging. This ensures you arrive with an optimal Battery temperature, reducing the amount of time it takes to charge. In some circumstances (such as cold weather), it is normal for the motor(s) and components to make noise as it generates heat to warm the Battery (see Charging on page 160).

- View how busy a Supercharger location typically is during different times of the day, along with corresponding charging fees and idle fees (see Supercharger Fees on page 179).

## Predicting Energy Usage

When navigating to a destination, Cybertruck helps you anticipate your charging needs by calculating the amount of energy that remains when you reach your destination. When navigating, the map displays this calculation next to the Battery icon on the turn-by-turn direction list (see Navigating to a Destination on page 164). When the turn-by-turn direction list is compressed, touch the top of the list to expand it.
---
# Maps and Navigation

The calculation that predicts how much energy you will use is an estimate based on driving style (predicted speed, etc.) and environmental factors (wind speed and direction, ambient and forecasted temperatures, air density and humidity, etc.). As you drive, Cybertruck continuously learns how much energy it uses, improving accuracy over time. Cybertruck predicts energy usage based on the driving style of the individual vehicle. For example, if you drive aggressively for a period of time, future range predictions will assume higher consumption. Some factors that contribute to predicted energy (such as forecasted temperatures and wind speed) are available only when Cybertruck has internet connectivity.

NOTE: If you purchase a used Tesla vehicle, it is recommended that you perform a factory reset (Controls > Service > Factory Reset) to ensure the predicted energy is as accurate as possible.

Throughout your route, Cybertruck monitors energy usage and updates the estimate of energy remaining at the end of your trip. A popup warning displays on the turn-by-turn direction list in these situations:

- A yellow warning displays when you have very little energy remaining to reach your destination, requiring you to drive slowly to conserve energy. For tips on conserving energy, see Getting Maximum Range on page 183.
- A red warning displays when you must charge to reach your destination.

To determine if you have enough energy for a round trip, touch the Battery icon on the turn-by-turn direction list to display an estimated calculation of your round trip energy usage.

## Online Routing

Cybertruck detects real-time traffic conditions and automatically adjusts the estimated driving and arrival times. In situations where traffic conditions may delay your estimated time of arrival and an alternate route is available, the navigation system can reroute you to your destination. To decline the alternate route, tap the reroute notification on your touchscreen. You can also specify the minimum number of minutes that must be saved before you are rerouted. Turn this feature on or off by touching Controls > Navigation > Online Routing.

## Trip Planner

Trip Planner (if available in your region) helps you take longer road trips with confidence. If reaching your destination requires charging, Trip Planner routes you through the appropriate Supercharger locations. Trip Planner selects a route and provides charging times to minimize the amount of time you spend driving and charging. To enable Trip Planner, touch the map's settings icon (see Navigation Settings on page 163), then touch Trip Planner.

When Trip Planner is enabled and charging is required to reach your destination, the turn-by-turn direction list includes Supercharger stops, recommended charging times at each Supercharger, and an estimate of how much energy will be available when you arrive at the Supercharger location.

To remove Supercharger stops and display directions only, touch Remove all charging stops at the bottom of the turn-by-turn direction list. If you remove charging stops, the turn-by-turn direction list may display an alert indicating that charging is needed to reach your destination. To add Supercharger stops back to the turn-by-turn direction list, touch Add charging stops.

While charging at a Supercharger, the charging screen displays the remaining charging time needed to drive to your next Supercharger stop or destination (if no further charging is needed). If you charge for a shorter or longer length of time, charging time at subsequent Supercharger stops is adjusted accordingly. You can also use the mobile app to monitor remaining charging time needed.

NOTE: When navigating to a Supercharger or, in some regions, a third-party fast charger using Trip Planner, Cybertruck may allocate some energy to pre-heat the Battery to arrive at the Supercharger or third-party fast charger with an optimal Battery temperature. This reduces charging time (see Charging on page 160).

If Trip Planner estimates that you won't have enough energy for your round trip, and there are no Superchargers available on your route, Trip Planner displays an alert at the top of the turn-by-turn direction list notifying you that charging is needed to reach your destination.

NOTE: If a Supercharger on your navigation route experiences an outage, Trip Planner displays a notification and attempts to reroute you to a different Supercharger location.

## Map Updates

As updated maps become available, they are automatically sent to Cybertruck over Wi-Fi. To ensure you receive them, periodically connect Cybertruck to a Wi-Fi network (see Wi-Fi on page 66). The touchscreen displays a message informing you when new maps are installed.

Navigation and Entertainment                                                                                                        167

## Charging Equipment

Charging equipment designed specifically to charge your Cybertruck is available from Tesla.

For information on the charging equipment available for your region, go to http://shop.tesla.com.

Tesla offers:

- Wall Connector: Installs in your parking space and is the fastest way to charge your vehicle for daily use.
- Mobile Connector: Allows you to plug into most commonly used power outlets. When using the Mobile Connector, attach the smart adapter (if required) to the Mobile Connector before plugging it in to the power outlet, and then plug in your vehicle.
- Adapters: Allows you to plug into the most commonly used public charging stations in your region. At a public charge station, first attach the adapter to the station's charging connector and then plug in your vehicle.

There is also a network of Superchargers, destination chargers, and other fast charging stations for when charging while traveling.

> **WARNING**: Assume that the low voltage components of Cybertruck, including all cables and connectors, are always energized. Do not handle low voltage cables or connect/disconnect connectors when the low voltage system is powered. Because the 48V low voltage system operates at a higher voltage than a typical low voltage system, there is an increased risk of personal injury, arcing, or component damage if the low voltage components of Cybertruck are handled improperly.

## Low Voltage Battery

Cybertruck uses a 48V lithium-ion low voltage battery. The 48V battery powers the windows, doors, touchscreen, and other low voltage vehicle systems when the high voltage Battery is unavailable. The 48V battery also provides a redundant source of power for critical systems (such as power steering).

**NOTE**: 48V low voltage connectors are colored blue for easy identification, and wires that operate at 48V are marked with blue tape.

By using a 48V low voltage battery instead of the 12V lead-acid battery found in many conventional vehicles, Cybertruck is able to operate more efficiently.

# High Voltage Battery Information

Cybertruck has one of the most sophisticated battery systems in the world. The most important way to preserve the high voltage Battery is to LEAVE YOUR VEHICLE PLUGGED IN when you are not using it. This is particularly important if you are not planning to drive Cybertruck for several weeks.

NOTE: If Cybertruck is unresponsive and does not unlock, open, or charge, the low voltage battery may be discharged. In this situation, try jump starting the low voltage battery (see Jump Starting on page 238). If the vehicle is still unresponsive, use the mobile app to schedule a service appointment.

NOTE: When left idle and unplugged, your vehicle periodically uses energy from the Battery for system tests and recharging the low voltage battery when necessary.

## Temperature Limits

For better long-term performance, avoid exposing Cybertruck to ambient temperatures above 140° F (60° C) or below -22° F (-30° C) for more than 24 hours at a time.

There is no advantage to waiting until the Battery's level is low before charging. In fact, the Battery performs best when charged regularly.

## Submerged Vehicle

NOTE: If you allow the Battery to discharge to 0%, other components may become damaged or require replacement (for example, the low voltage battery). In these cases, you are responsible for repair and/or transporting expenses. Discharge-related expenses are not covered by the warranty or under the Roadside Assistance policy.

As with any vehicle, if your Tesla has been exposed to flooding, extreme weather events or has otherwise been submerged in water (especially in salt water), treat it as if it's been in an accident and contact your insurance company for support. Do not attempt to operate the vehicle before Tesla Service has inspected it, but you should tow or move it away from any structures.

The peak charging rate of the Battery may decrease slightly after a large number of DC Fast Charging sessions, such as those at Superchargers. To ensure maximum driving range and Battery safety, the Battery charge rate is decreased when the Battery is too cold, the Battery's charge is nearly full, and when the Battery conditions change with usage and age. These changes in the condition of the Battery are driven by battery physics and may increase the total Supercharging duration by a few minutes over time. You can minimize the amount of charge time by using Trip Planner (if available in your market region) to warm the Battery while driving to a Supercharger. See Trip Planner on page 167 for more information.

An unintentionally submerged vehicle is different than a vehicle that intentionally enters water while off-roading. In these situations, use Wade Mode. See Off-Road Driving on page 100 for more information.

NOTE: Damage caused by water is not covered under warranty.

## Battery Warnings and Cautions

WARNING: The high voltage system must be serviced only by a trained technician. Under no circumstances should you open or tamper with the Battery. Do not disassemble, remove or replace high voltage components, cables or connectors. High voltage cables are typically colored orange for easy identification.

## Battery Care

Never allow the Battery to fully discharge.

Even when Cybertruck is not being driven, its Battery discharges very slowly to power the onboard electronics. The Battery can discharge at a rate of approximately 1% per day, though the discharge rate may vary depending on environmental factors (such as cold weather), vehicle configuration, and your selected settings on the touchscreen. Situations can arise in which you must leave Cybertruck unplugged for an extended period of time (for example, at an airport when traveling). In these situations, keep the 1% in mind to ensure that you leave the Battery with a sufficient charge level. For example, over a two week period (14 days), the Battery may discharge by approximately 14%.

Discharging the Battery to 0% may result in damage to vehicle components. To protect against a complete discharge, Cybertruck enters a low-power consumption mode when the displayed charge level drops to approximately 0%. In this mode, the Battery stops supporting the onboard electronics and auxiliary low voltage battery. Once this low-power consumption mode is active, immediately plug in Cybertruck to prevent a jump start and low voltage battery replacement.

CAUTION: If the Battery's charge level falls to 0%, you must plug it in. If you leave it unplugged for an extended period, it may not be possible to charge or use Cybertruck without jump starting or replacing the low voltage battery. Leaving Cybertruck unplugged for an extended period can also result in permanent Battery damage. If you are unable to charge Cybertruck after attempting to jump start the low voltage battery, schedule a service appointment.

CAUTION: The Battery requires no owner maintenance. Do not remove the coolant filler cap and do not add fluid. If the touchscreen warns you that the fluid level is low, use the mobile app to schedule a service appointment.

# Charging Instructions

## Opening the Charge Port

The charge port is located above the driver's side rear wheel of Cybertruck.

With Cybertruck in Park and a valid key is detected, press and release the button on the Tesla charge cable to open the charge port door.

[Image of a Tesla charging cable with an arrow pointing to the button]

The Cybertruck icon lights up white when you open the charge port door (see Charge Port Light on page 177). If you do not insert a charge cable into the charge port within a few minutes after opening the charge port door, the charge port door closes. If this happens, open the charge port door again.

NOTE: In extremely cold weather or icy conditions, it is possible that your charge port latch may freeze in place. If this happens, you can thaw ice on the charge port latch by turning on the rear defrost or by enabling preconditioning using the mobile app. To prevent this from occurring, use the Schedule settings, which are also available on both the charging and climate control screens, to schedule a Precondition by (see Preconditioning on page 181).

⚠️ CAUTION: Do not try to force the charge port door open.

You can also open the charge port door using any of these methods:

- On the touchscreen, touch the charge port on the vehicle avatar and touch Open.
- On the touchscreen, touch Controls > Charging > Open Charge Port.
- Press the charge port door when Cybertruck is unlocked and an authenticated phone is nearby.
- When the vehicle is locked with an authenticated key in range, you can also press the button on the charge cable to open the charge port door (see Keys on page 30).
- Use voice commands. You can also use voice commands to close the charge port door, and begin or stop charging (see Voice Commands on page 25).
- Use the mobile app.

## During Charging

Tesla strongly recommends leaving Cybertruck plugged in when not in use. This maintains the Battery at the optimum level of charge.

During charging, the charge port light (the Cybertruck icon) pulses green, and the touchscreen displays real-time charging status. The frequency at which the green charge port light pulses slows down as the charge level approaches full. When charging is complete, the light stops pulsing and is solid green. If Cybertruck is locked, the charge port light does not light up. For more information, see Charge Port Light on page 177.

If the charge port light turns red while charging, there is an issue with charging. Check the touchscreen for an alert describing the issue. An issue can occur due to something as common as a power outage. If a power outage occurs, charging resumes automatically when power is restored.

NOTE: Cybertruck cannot charge from Gen 1 Wall Connectors if the charge current on the Wall Connector is greater than 48A (the front cover plate of Gen 1 Wall Connectors have a metal finish). When you attempt to charge a Cybertruck from a Gen 1 Wall Connector with a charge current that's configured incorrectly, the lights on the Wall Connector flash red eight times. For more information on changing the charge current, see https://www.tesla.com/support/charging/product-guides#gen-1-wall-connector.

NOTE: The thermal system may produce steam while Cybertruck charges. For example, odorless steam can come from the front of your vehicle while charging at a Supercharger in cold temperatures. This is normal and not a cause for concern. Likewise, it is normal to hear sounds during charging. Particularly at high currents, the refrigerant compressor and fan operate as needed to keep the Battery cool.

[Image of a Cybertruck charge port with an arrow pointing to it]

# Charging Instructions

NOTE: Air conditioning performance is generally not affected by charging. However, in some circumstances (for example, charging at high currents during a particularly warm day), the air coming from the vents may not be as cool as expected and a message displays on the touchscreen. This is normal and ensures that the Battery stays within an optimal temperature range while charging to support longevity and optimum performance.

⚠️ WARNING: Never spray liquid at a high velocity (for example, a pressure washer) towards the charge port while charging. Doing so can result in serious injury or damage to the vehicle, charging equipment, or property.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not use third-party charging adapters with Cybertruck.

⚠️ CAUTION: Keep the cargo bed outlet cover closed when Cybertruck is charging, especially in wet weather. Charging may be disabled if moisture enters one of the outlets.

## Charging Status

On the touchscreen, the charging status displays at the top of the vehicle status area when the charge port door is open.

2. Time remaining: The estimated time remaining to charge to your set limit. Or, if you are navigating to a destination, the estimated time remaining until you can continue your trip.

   NOTE: When charging to 100%, the Cybertruck may continue to charge with low power when charging is displayed as complete. This is expected. Because the added energy beyond this point is low, it is usually not beneficial to continue charging.

3. Range: The total estimated driving distance or energy percentage (depending on your display setting) available.

   NOTE: To change how energy units are displayed, touch Controls > Display > Energy Display. You can also touch the driving distance or energy percentage on the touchscreen to switch between them.

4. Charging: The amount of power currently being provided by the charger.

5. Charging rate: The speed at which the vehicle is charging, shown in range gained per hour.

6. Range gained: The estimated increase in driving distance achieved in the charging session.

## Charge Port Light

Above the charge port, the charge port light shows charging status. The charge port light turns off after a short period of time if the vehicle is locked (for example, if you walk up to the vehicle after it has been charging for a while).

After you insert a charge cable into Cybertruck, wait a few seconds and confirm that the charge port light begins blinking green and that your vehicle is charging. If the light is amber or red, troubleshoot the issue before you leave to ensure a successful charging session.

WHITE: The charge port door is open. Cybertruck is ready to charge and the connector is not inserted, or the charge port latch is unlocked and the connector is ready to be removed.

BLUE, BLINKING: Cybertruck is communicating with the charger but has not started charging or providing power yet (such as when your vehicle is preparing to charge, or when your vehicle is preparing to provide power from the high voltage Battery).

BLUE: The charger is connected, but Cybertruck is not charging (such as when scheduled charging is active).

PURPLE, BLINKING: Cybertruck is providing power from the high voltage Battery. The frequency of blinking corresponds to the amount of power that Cybertruck is providing (more frequent blinks correspond to more power being provided). For more information, see Powershare Home Backup on page 185.

# Charging Instructions

GREEN, BLINKING: Charging is in progress. As Cybertruck approaches a full charge, the frequency of the blinking slows.

GREEN, SOLID: Charging is complete.

AMBER, BLINKING: Cybertruck is charging at a reduced current because the connector is not fully plugged in.

AMBER, SOLID: Cybertruck is not charging because the connector is not fully plugged in. Realign the connector to the charge port and insert fully.

RED: A fault is detected and charging has stopped. Check the touchscreen for an alert. In some cases, an alert can be easily cleared by unplugging the charge cable, returning it to the charger, then trying again. In other cases (such as a tripped fuse or a faulty charger), you may need to check the power source. If the red light persists, try using a different charger.

The charge port door closes automatically shortly after you remove the charge cable.

You can also automatically stop charging from a specified time by creating a charge schedule. For more information, see Create a Schedule on page 181.

## Charge Settings

Access charge settings by touching Controls > Charging when Cybertruck is in Park. You can also touch the Battery icon on the touchscreen to access charge settings.

| 1 | 2 |

1. Energy available: Displays the remaining energy available in the high voltage Battery. To show the remaining energy as estimated driving distance (miles or kilometers) rather than a percentage, touch Controls > Display > Energy Display.

2. Set charge limit: Adjust the charge slider to the level of charging you want. The setting you choose applies to immediate and scheduled charging sessions.

NOTE: Refer to the information on the touchscreen (navigate to Controls > Charging) or mobile app (touch the Charging icon) for recommended daily and trip charging limits.

NOTE: A portion of the Battery image may appear blue. This indicates that a small portion of the energy stored in the Battery is not available because the Battery is cold. This is normal and no reason for concern. When the Battery warms up, the blue portion no longer displays.

## Stopping Charging

Stop charging at any time by pressing the button on the charge cable to disconnect, or touch Stop Charging on the touchscreen or mobile app. To disconnect the charge cable:

1. Ensure your vehicle is unlocked. To prevent unauthorized unplugging of the charge cable, the charge cable latch remains locked and Cybertruck must be unlocked before you can disconnect the charge cable.

2. Press and hold the button on the connector handle to release the latch.

3. Pull the connector from the charge port. The charge port door automatically closes.

To disconnect the charge cable when using an adapter at a public charge station:

1. Unlock Cybertruck.

2. While holding the public charging handle in one hand and the adapter in the other hand, press and hold the button on the public charging handle and pull both outwards, removing the handle and adapter at the same time.
   NOTE: If the charging station handle separates from the adapter, leaving the adapter in Cybertruck, use the touchscreen to unlock the charge port.

3. Press and hold the button on the charging handle again to release the adapter from the public charging handle.

## Open/Unlock Charge Port

When not charging, touch Open Charge Port or Unlock Charge Port to open the charge port door or to unlock the charge cable from the charge port.

## Stop Charging

Use Stop Charging when you are finished charging.

## Charge Current at this Location
---
# Charging Instructions

The current automatically sets to the maximum current available from the attached charge cable, unless it was previously reduced to a lower level. If needed, touch - or + to change the current (for example, you may want to reduce the current if you are concerned about overloading a domestic wiring circuit shared by other equipment). It is not possible to set the charging current to a level that exceeds the maximum available from the attached charge cable. When you change the current, Cybertruck remembers the location.

NOTE: When charging with the Mobile Connector, your vehicle may automatically select a default charge current. Override this default current to a higher setting by customizing Charge Current at this location or through the mobile app.

If Cybertruck is charging and detects unexpected fluctuations in input power, the charging current is automatically reduced by 25%. For example, a 40 amp current is reduced to 30 amps. This automatic current reduction increases robustness and safety in situations when an external problem exists (for example, a home wiring system, receptacle, adapter or cord is unable to meet its rated current capacity). As a precaution, when Cybertruck automatically reduces current, it saves the reduced current at the charging location. Although you can manually increase it, Tesla recommends charging at the lower current until the underlying problem is resolved and the charging location can provide consistent power.

## Supercharging

Displays Supercharger usage fees, the location, the time that charging started, and a cost estimate for the session. To reduce congestion at high-usage Supercharger sites, you may be limited to a maximum charge of 80% when not using Trip Planner (if available in your market region). See Supercharger Fees on page 179.

NOTE: Tesla does not recommend using low-power charging equipment (such as a 120V NEMA 5-15 outlet and the Universal Mobile Connector) to charge Cybertruck, especially in low ambient temperatures. Due to the size of the high voltage Battery, charging with equipment that produces less than 2 kW of power will charge Cybertruck very slowly. If you are charging Cybertruck with such a method, turn off climate to reduce idle power consumption while charging.

## Supercharger Fees

When charging at a Tesla Supercharger, information about the charging session displays at the bottom of the charging screen. This includes the location, the time that charging started, and a cost estimate for the session. When you stop Supercharging, the estimated cost of the session displays until a new Supercharging session begins.

NOTE: Estimated cost may not reflect the final cost of the Supercharging session. Final pricing for Supercharging sessions can be found in your Tesla account.

You are subject to additional fees after charging is complete or, at a busy Supercharger location, after your vehicle has reached the congestion limit. Superchargers are designed for fast charging, and these fees encourage drivers to move their vehicles when charging is complete.

Idle fees apply when half or more of the Superchargers at a site are occupied, and begin accruing when the vehicle reaches its charge limit. The Tesla mobile app notifies you when charging is almost complete, and again when charging is complete. Additional notifications are sent if idle fees are incurred. Idle fees are waived if you move your vehicle within five minutes of when charging completed.

The rate structure for each site, including whether idle fees apply, can be found on the site's popup on the touchscreen (see Charging Locations on page 166) or in the Tesla mobile app.

Log into your Tesla account to view fees and details about Supercharger sessions, set up a payment method, and make payments. Once a payment method is saved, fees are automatically paid from your account.

## Manually Releasing Charge Cable

CAUTION: Use the release cable only in situations where you can not release the charge cable using the usual methods. Frequent use can damage the release cable or charging equipment.

WARNING: Do not perform this procedure when your vehicle is charging, or if any orange high voltage connectors are exposed. Failure to follow these instructions can result in electric shock and serious injury or damage to the vehicle. If you are uncertain as to how to safely perform this procedure, use the mobile app to schedule a service appointment.

If the usual methods for releasing a charge cable from the charge port (using the charge handle release button, touchscreen, or mobile app) do not work, carefully follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Cybertruck is not actively charging by navigating to Controls > Charging on the touchscreen, or use the mobile app. If necessary, touch Stop Charging.

2. Open the tailgate.

3. Pull firmly on the edges of the panel on the left side of the bed to release the panel's clips and expose the release cable. The panel does not fully come off, but can be pulled just far enough to reach the cable.

# Charging Instructions

## Charging Best Practices

- Avoid allowing the Battery to get too low (the Battery icon turns yellow when the capacity remaining in the Battery drops to 20% or below).

- Refer to the information on the vehicle touchscreen (navigate to Controls > Charging) or the mobile app (touch the Charging icon) for recommended daily and trip charging limits.

- Before you navigate to a destination charging location, such as a short-term rental or hotel, ensure that the available Wall Connectors are configured for a 48A charge current. Cybertruck cannot charge from Gen 1 Wall Connectors with a charge current greater than 48A.

- After you plug in your vehicle, confirm that the charge port light begins blinking green (indicating that Cybertruck is charging) before you walk away. If Cybertruck does not begin charging after a few seconds, the connector may not be fully inserted into the charge port, or there may be an issue preventing charging. Check the touchscreen for an alert with more information.

4. Pull the release cable to unlatch the charge cable.

   ⚠️ WARNING: Do not pull the release cable while simultaneously attempting to remove the charge cable from the charge port. Always pull the release cable before attempting to remove the charge cable. Failure to follow these instructions can result in electric shock and serious injury.

NOTE: If the charge port light begins blinking amber, Cybertruck is charging at a reduced current. If the charge port light is solid blue, the charger is connected but the vehicle is not charging (such as when a charge is scheduled). For more information, see Charge Port Light on page 177.

## Fast charging tips:

- Find fast chargers by filtering for three lightning bolts in the navigation search bar.

- Navigate to fast chargers to allow for preconditioning of the high voltage Battery. An optimal Battery temperature can help speed up charging.

- Typically, a lower state of charge results in faster charging.

NOTE: It is your responsibility to monitor your vehicle's charge at all times. Do not wait until the vehicle is discharged to plug it in. Always ensure you have more than enough charge to safely get to a charger.

- At Superchargers, leave some space between other vehicles, as neighboring stalls may share power.

NOTE: The release cable may be recessed within the opening of the trim.

5. Pull and release the charge cable from the charge port.

6. Reinstall the panel, ensuring that the clips are fully engaged.

# Scheduled Precondition and Charge

Schedule preconditioning and charging for Cybertruck. You can schedule preconditioning to help your vehicle charge more efficiently, or to prepare Cybertruck for departure.

NOTE: You can also access Schedule from the Climate Controls screen, the Charging window, and the Tesla mobile app (v4.34.5 or higher required).

Cybertruck automatically saves your schedule for each location you create a schedule at. When you select Current Location, the configured schedule can only be used when you return to the same approximate physical location.

NOTE: Scheduled charge cannot be used with fast chargers, including Tesla Superchargers. Charging schedules you create are ignored when you charge at a fast charger.

## Create a Schedule

Create a Precondition and Charge schedule to specify the time and days you want Cybertruck to precondition or charge. To create a schedule:

1. Touch Controls > Schedule.
2. Select the location for which you want to configure a schedule.
   - Current Location: The current location of your car, based on your GPS coordinates.
     NOTE: You must be parked to create a schedule for your current location.
   - Home/Work: The saved location for your home and workplace. You can't choose these options if you don't have a saved home or work (see Home, Work, and Favorite Destinations on page 165).
3. Touch Precondition to configure the time and the frequency you want the vehicle to precondition by.
4. Touch Charge to configure the time you want to start and stop, and the frequency you want to charge.
5. Select Create to create the schedule.

NOTE: If Repeat Weekly is not toggled, Cybertruck performs the schedule once. The vehicle then disables the schedule until you manually re-enable the schedule.

## Using Scheduled Charging

When you create or enable a scheduled charge, you can plug in your vehicle for a charge. If you scheduled a precondition or charge for later in the day, Cybertruck waits until that time to precondition or charge.

When your schedules overlap, the vehicle uses the largest block of time for charging, if necessary. Example: You scheduled Cybertruck to start charging at 2 AM and at 3 AM, but to stop charging at 2:30 AM and 5 AM, the vehicle combines the two charge schedules into a single block from 2 AM to 5 AM.

When you specify an End by time, but not a Start at time, the vehicle briefly draws power when plugging in for scheduled charging (you may hear clicking) to calculate the necessary start time to meet your charge limit. Example: You configure an End by time of 2 AM and the vehicle needs 2 hours to charge to meet the charge limit. If you plug in your vehicle at 9 PM, Cybertruck briefly draws power to calculate the start time and begins charging at 12 AM.

If you specify a Start at time and no End by time, the vehicle begins charging at the specified time and continues until your charge limit is reached.

There are scenarios where Scheduled Charging starts immediately. These scenarios can occur when Cybertruck is plugged in:

- During a scheduled charge.
- Up to 6 hours after the start of a scheduled charge, if there is no specified End by time.
- When the next scheduled charge is more than 18 hours away and not the current day.
- When you haven't configured a Start at time and there is not enough time to reach the charge limit by the End by time.

NOTE: Cybertruck does NOT automatically start charging if you plug in your vehicle within 6 hours after the End by time of a scheduled charge, unless there is another scheduled charge.

You can schedule your charge to finish right at a planned departure time to reduce energy costs, even in market regions where off-peak utility rates are not applicable. Example, if charging starts as soon as you plug in, charging may complete much sooner. This causes the Battery to cool down to ambient temperatures and requires energy to warm it back up by your departure time. Therefore, even if off-peak utility rates are not applicable to you, Tesla recommends that you charge until your planned departure time in order to reduce energy consumption by specifying your departure time as the scheduled End by time.

## Preconditioning

Use Precondition to schedule a time when you want Cybertruck to be ready to drive. Cybertruck automatically calculates when it needs to start preconditioning. This ensures that the cabin climate and Battery are preconditioned by your departure time.

Precondition warms the Battery for improved performance and ensures a comfortable cabin climate at your set departure time. If you don't schedule a Precondition, Cybertruck only warms the Battery before charging if the Battery is too cold to charge, and doesn't prepare the cabin climate.

NOTE: When Cybertruck is not plugged in, preconditioning operates but only when the Battery's charge level is above 20%.

# Scheduled Precondition and Charge

Preconditioning can also help to increase range on your next trip because a preconditioned cabin and battery consumes less energy when you begin driving. Preconditioning can reduce energy consumption while driving in vehicles with heat pumps, because heat in the battery can be used to warm the cabin while driving.

# Getting Maximum Range

## Factors Affecting Energy Consumption

### While driving:

- Elevated driving speed.
- Environmental conditions such as cold or hot weather and wind.
- Using climate controls to heat or cool the cabin.
- Uphill travel: Driving uphill requires more energy and depletes range at a faster rate. However, driving downhill allows your vehicle to regain a portion of its expended energy through regenerative braking (see Regenerative Braking on page 87).
- Short trips or stop-and-go traffic: It takes energy to bring the cabin and Battery to a specified temperature when starting the vehicle. You may see a higher average consumption when the vehicle is used for very short trips or in heavy traffic.
- Heavy cargo load.
- Windows rolled down.
- The tonneau cover staying open.
- Towing a trailer.
- Driving on soft or sandy terrain (see Off-Road Driving on page 100).
- Wheels and tires not maintained.
- Customized settings or third-party accessories (roof or trunk racks, third party wheels).

### While parked and not plugged in to a charger:

- Preconditioning the cabin or using climate controls.
- Summon.
- Vehicle infotainment and climate controls system.
- Sentry mode.
- Tesla or third-party mobile app requests.
- The outlets in the cabin or the cargo bed are in use. For more information, see Interior Electronics on page 20 and Cargo Bed Outlets on page 23.

## Tips to Maximize Range

You can maximize your driving range using the same driving habits you use to conserve fuel in a gasoline-powered vehicle. To achieve maximum range:

- Slow down your driving and avoid frequent and rapid acceleration. Consider using Chill Mode (touch Controls > Acceleration) and Speed Assist (see Speed Assist on page 147) to assist in controlling your acceleration and speed.

- If safe to do so, modulate the accelerator pedal instead of using the brake pedal when gradually slowing down. Whenever Cybertruck is moving and you are not pressing the accelerator pedal, regenerative braking slows down the vehicle and feeds surplus energy back to the Battery (see Regenerative Braking on page 87).

- Limit the use of resources such as heating and air conditioning. Using seat and steering wheel heaters (if equipped) to keep warm is more efficient than heating the cabin using climate controls.

- With your vehicle plugged in, use the mobile app to precondition your vehicle to ensure the cabin is at a comfortable temperature and windows are defrosted (if needed) before your drive by touching Climate > On and customizing your preferences (see Mobile App on page 64).

- Touch Schedule, (also available on both the charging and climate control screens) to set a time when you want your vehicle to be ready to drive (see Scheduled Precondition and Charge on page 181).

- Ensure the wheels are aligned to specification, the tires are kept at the recommended inflation pressures (see Tire Pressures on page 195), and are rotated when needed (see Maintenance Service Intervals on page 189).

- Install wheel covers (if equipped) to reduce wind resistance.

- Lighten your load by removing any unnecessary cargo.

- Fully raise all windows and close the tonneau cover.

- Features such as Sentry Mode and Cabin Overheat Protection can impact range. Disable features when not needed.

- To prevent an excessive amount of energy consumption while the vehicle is idle, keep the vehicle plugged in when not in use.

## Range Assurance

The driving range displayed in Cybertruck is an estimate of the remaining battery energy based on EPA-rated consumption. It may not account for your personal driving patterns or external conditions. The displayed range on the may decrease faster than the actual distance driven.

Your vehicle continuously monitors its energy level and proximity to known charging locations.

It is normal for estimated range to decrease slightly over the first few months before leveling off. Over time, you may see a gradual, but natural, decrease in range at full charge – this depends on factors such as the mileage and age of the Battery. Your Cybertruck will inform you in the unlikely event a hardware issue is causing excessive Battery or range degradation.

# Powershare Home Backup

Powershare Home Backup also stops providing power when:

- The high voltage Battery discharges past the Powershare
  discharge limit.
- The electric grid starts supplying power (the power
  outage ends).

When the grid is about to start providing power again, you
receive a notification from the Tesla mobile app and on the
vehicle touchscreen.

⚠️ CAUTION: When the grid begins providing power to
your home again, your home may lose power for
several seconds as Cybertruck stops providing power.

## Limitations

Be aware of the following limitations when using Powershare
Home Backup.

- While Cybertruck is actively providing power to your
  home, the AC outlets in the cabin and in the cargo bed are
  disabled (see Interior Electronics on page 20 and Cargo
  Bed Outlets on page 23).

If Powershare Home Backup stops providing power, you
receive a notification on the vehicle touchscreen and through
the Tesla mobile app. This may happen for one of the
following reasons.

- Your home is drawing more power than Powershare Home
  Backup can provide. In this case, reduce the load as much
  as possible (for example, by turning off large appliances).
- The high voltage Battery is cold. This is more likely in low
  ambient temperatures (for example, if Cybertruck is
  parked in a cold garage) or if Cybertruck has not been
  driven recently.
- There is an issue with the Universal Wall Connector, with
  your vehicle's charge port, or with your vehicle's high
  voltage Battery. Check the touchscreen for an alert with
  more information.

# Software Updates

## Loading New Software

Tesla updates your vehicle's software wirelessly, constantly providing new features. Tesla recommends you install software updates at the earliest opportunity on your vehicle. To ensure the fastest and most reliable delivery of software updates, leave Wi-Fi turned on and connected whenever possible. In most cases, your vehicle must be connected to Wi-Fi to download the software update (see Wi-Fi on page 66).

> WARNING: Do not attempt to use the vehicle while the software is being installed. Vehicle functions, including some safety systems and opening or closing the doors or windows, may be limited or disabled when installation is in progress and you could damage the vehicle.

## Software Update Preferences

Tesla determines how, when, and where to send updates to vehicles based on various factors unique to each release. In Controls > Software, you can choose how quickly you want to receive updates that are ready for your vehicle. Be an early adopter by selecting Advanced (which will have additional releases), or wait until others have installed (which will result in fewer releases) by selecting Standard. Choosing Advanced does not enroll your vehicle in Tesla's early access program.

Tesla does not update your software upon request for those wanting to receive the latest features and improvements. Selecting Advanced and consistently connecting to Wi-Fi (see Wi-Fi on page 66) is the best way to quickly receive the latest software updates.

If the touchscreen displays a message indicating that a software update was not successfully completed, wait for the next software update to deploy to your vehicle.

NOTE: The software update screen persists until you install the update. Install a software update as soon as possible. Any harm resulting from failure to install a software update is not covered by the vehicle's warranty. Failure or refusal to install updates can cause some vehicle features to become inaccessible or digital media devices may become incompatible.

NOTE: Tesla may update or reinstall your vehicle's software as part of the normal diagnostic, repair, and maintenance process within Tesla Service.

NOTE: Reverting to a previous software version is not possible.

## Downloading vs. Installing New Software

There are two steps to receiving a new update: downloading the software (which requires Wi-Fi), and installing it. For your convenience, you can start downloads and installations using the Tesla mobile app.

### Download

When a software update is available for download, the download occurs automatically, showing a green arrow at the top of the touchscreen. If the vehicle is not connected to Wi-Fi, a yellow download icon appears. Although you can drive while the software update is being downloaded, doing so can interrupt the download if your vehicle loses the Wi-Fi connection. When the software update is fully downloaded and ready to install, a clock icon displays at the top of the touchscreen.

NOTE: To ensure the fastest and most reliable download of software updates, leave the Wi-Fi turned on and connected whenever possible (see Wi-Fi on page 66).

### Install

# Maintenance Service Intervals

## Service Intervals

Tesla recommends the following maintenance items and intervals, as applicable to your vehicle, to ensure continued reliability and efficiency of your Cybertruck.

For additional information on vehicle alerts, see Troubleshooting Alerts on page 242.

- Brake fluid health check every 4 years (replace if necessary)*.
- A/C desiccant bag replacement every 8 years.
- HEPA filter replacement every 2 years, or every year in cases of off-road/dirt road driving.
- Clean and lubricate brake calipers every year or 12,500 miles (20,000 km) if in an area where roads are salted during winter.
- Rotate tires every 6,250 miles (10,000 km) or if tread depth difference is 2/32 in (1.5 mm) or greater, whichever comes first.

*Heavy brake usage due to towing, mountain descents, or performance driving -- especially for vehicles in hot and humid environments -- may necessitate more frequent brake fluid checks and replacements.

NOTE: Any damage caused by opening the Battery coolant reservoir is excluded from the warranty.

NOTE: The above intervals are based on typical driving behaviors and scenarios. Depending on various circumstances such as driving behavior, usage, environmental conditions, etc., the above maintenance items may need to be performed more or less frequently than specified. Additionally, the above list should not be considered comprehensive and does not include consumable parts such as the windshield wiper, brake pads, etc.

NOTE: Damages or failures caused by maintenance or repairs performed by non-Tesla certified technicians are not covered by the warranty.

For more do-it-yourself maintenance procedures and information, see https://www.tesla.com/support/do-it-yourself-guides.

## Schedule Service

Scheduling a service visit through the mobile app is easy. After touching Service, select the type of service needed and follow the directions in the mobile app. Provide as much detail as possible to better help the Service team identify the cause of concern, such as:

- Photos, sound recordings, or videos.
- Date(s), time(s), and time zone when the issue occurred.
- Approximate speed the vehicle was traveling (if applicable).
- Environmental conditions (rain, snow, cold, etc.).
- Road name and type of road (if applicable).
- Quality of lane markings (if applicable).
- Applicable vehicle settings.
- Identifiable symptoms.

Visit https://www.tesla.com/support/service-visits for more information on scheduling service.

## Daily Checks

- Check the Battery's charge level, displayed on the touchscreen or mobile app.
- Check the condition and pressure of each tire (see Tire Pressures on page 195).
- Check that all exterior lights, horn, turn signals, and the wiper and washers are working.
- Check for any unexpected indicator lights or vehicle alerts on the touchscreen.
- Check the operation of the brakes, including the parking brake.

NOTE: Because Cybertruck uses regenerative braking (see Regenerative Braking on page 87), the brake pads are typically used less frequently than those in traditional braking systems. To avoid the accumulation of rust and corrosion, Tesla recommends frequently pressing the brake pedal to apply the mechanical brakes, which dries the brake pads and rotors.

- Check the operation of the seat belts (see Seat Belts on page 39).
- Look for abnormal fluid deposits underneath Cybertruck that might indicate a leak. It is normal for a small pool of water to form (caused by the air conditioning system's dehumidifying process).
- Look around the exterior of Cybertruck and immediately remove any corrosive substances (such as bird droppings, tree resin, tar spots, dead insects, industrial fallout, etc.) to prevent damage to the exterior (see Cleaning on page 191).

## Weekly Checks

- During wet weather, clean Autopilot cameras weekly (see Cleaning a Camera on page 28). Otherwise, clean them monthly during dry weather.

## Monthly Checks

- Check windshield washer fluid level and top up if necessary (see Topping Up Windshield Washer Fluid on page 208).
- Check that the air conditioning system is operating correctly (see Operating Climate Controls on page 154).

Maintenance                                                                 189

# Maintenance Service Intervals

NOTE: In addition to cooling the interior, the air conditioning compressor also cools the Battery. Therefore, in hot weather, the air conditioning compressor can turn on even if you turned it off. This is normal because the system's priority is to cool the Battery to ensure it stays within an optimum temperature range to support longevity and optimum performance. Also, even when not in use, you may hear Cybertruck emit a whining noise or the sound of water circulating. These sounds are normal and occur when the internal cooling systems turn on to support various vehicle functions, such as maintaining the low voltage battery and balancing the temperature of the high voltage Battery.

## Periodic Checks

Perform the following checks as needed:

Over time, when driving in dusty or polluted conditions, your vehicle's radiator may become clogged. This can affect air flow and heating/AC performance. Use the mobile app to schedule a service appointment.

## Fluid Replacement Intervals

Battery coolant and brake fluid levels should only be checked by Tesla or a professional automotive repair shop. Specific service information is available in the Service Manual.

- Battery coolant: Your Battery coolant does not need to be replaced for the life of your vehicle under most circumstances.

NOTE: Any damage caused by opening the Battery coolant reservoir is excluded from the warranty.

- Brake fluid: Do not top up your brake fluid.

## Software

Updating software is important to ensure proper operation and longevity of your vehicle's components. You must install a software update at the earliest opportunity. See Software Updates on page 188.

Tesla may update or reinstall your vehicle's software as part of the normal diagnostic, repair, and maintenance process within Service.

## High Voltage Safety

Your Cybertruck has been designed and built with safety as a priority. However, be aware of these precautions to protect yourself from the risk of injury inherent in all high-voltage systems:

- Read and follow all instructions provided on the labels that are attached to Cybertruck. These labels are there for your safety.

- The high voltage system has no user-serviceable parts. Do not disassemble, remove or replace high voltage components, cables or connectors. High voltage cables are colored orange for easy identification.

- If a collision occurs, do not touch any high voltage wiring, connectors, or components connected to the wiring.

- In the unlikely event that a fire occurs, immediately contact your local fire emergency responders.

WARNING: Assume that the low voltage components of Cybertruck, including all cables and connectors, are always energized. 48V low voltage connectors are colored blue for easy identification, and wires that operate at 48V are marked with blue tape.

Do not handle low voltage cables or connect/ disconnect connectors when the low voltage system is powered. Because the 48V low voltage system operates at a higher voltage than a typical low voltage system, there is an increased risk of personal injury, arcing, or component damage if the low voltage components of Cybertruck are handled improperly.

WARNING: Always disconnect the charge cable before working underneath Cybertruck, even if charging is not in progress.

WARNING: Keep your hands and clothing away from cooling fans. Some fans operate even when Cybertruck is powered off.

WARNING: Some fluids (Battery acid, Battery coolant, brake fluid, windshield washer additives, etc.) used in vehicles are poisonous and should not be inhaled, swallowed, or brought into contact with open wounds. For your safety, always read and follow instructions printed on fluid containers.

# Cleaning

## Cleaning the Exterior

To prevent damage to the exterior, immediately remove corrosive substances (such as grease, oil, bird droppings, tree resin, dead insects, tar spots, road salt, industrial fallout, etc.). Do not wait until Cybertruck is due for a complete wash. If necessary, use denatured alcohol to remove tar spots and stubborn grease stains, then immediately wash the area with water and a mild, non-detergent soap to remove the alcohol.

> CAUTION: Some cleaners and car shampoos contain chemicals that can cause damage or discoloration, especially for plastic trim pieces, exterior lights, or camera lenses. For example, some car cleaning formulas contain hydroxide or other highly alkaline or caustic ingredients that can damage exterior components. Do not use acidic products either. Damage or discoloration resulting from cleaning products is not covered by the warranty.

NOTE: It is normal for the stainless steel exterior to mature over time, resulting in minor changes to the reflective properties and color of the metal.

4. After washing, rinse with clean water to prevent soap from drying on the surfaces.
5. Dry thoroughly with microfiber cloths (ensure the cloths are clean of sand, dirt, rocks, etc.), one in each hand, rotating in circular motions until the surface is dry.

### Dents and Scratches

The stainless steel exterior of Cybertruck is more resistant to dents and dings than most other vehicles. However, Cybertruck does not have a clear coat on the surface of the exterior body panels, meaning any scratches that appear are in the stainless steel panels themselves. Anyone performing scratch repair should refer to the applicable "Exterior Stainless Steel Panel Refinishing" procedure within the Collision Repair Manual on service.tesla.com. In addition, do not use, and/or immediately remove, chemical, corrosive, or non-pH neutral substances (including but not limited to: acidic liquids or materials, grease, oil, tree resin, dead insects, tar spots, road salt, industrial fallout, etc.) as they can cause corrosion on the vehicle's exterior.

> CAUTION: Tesla is not liable for any damage caused by failing to refer to official guidance.

### Surface Contamination

Over time, you may notice contamination on the surface of the stainless steel body panels. These spots may appear as orange or brown rust. However, it is important to note that your Cybertruck is not rusting. Refer to the DIY Guide for more information.

Keep the exterior cameras free of dirt, condensation, or obstructions. These substances can cause unclear pictures or Autopilot and safety features to stop working (see Cleaning a Camera on page 28).

Follow these steps when washing the exterior of Cybertruck:

1. Before washing, flush grime and grit from the vehicle using a hose. Flush away accumulations of mud in areas where debris easily collects (such as wheel wells and panel seams). If salt has been used on the highways (such as during winter months), thoroughly rinse all traces of road salt from the underside of the vehicle, wheel wells, and brakes.

2. Mix a mild, pH-neutral soap (such as car shampoo) with water until it gets soapy.

3. Soak a soft cleaning sponge in the soap mixture and hand wash Cybertruck.

### For a waterless wash:

1. Hand wash using a non-ionic pH-neutral waterless wash with a high quality microfiber towel.

2. Dry any streaks thoroughly with a chamois.

3. Remove oil and grease with an organic solvent, such as alcohol or ethyl alcohol.

NOTE: Do not use alcohol or ethyl alcohol on the head or tail lights.

### For spot cleaning: 
Use a glass cleaner and microfiber cloth. Spray glass cleaner and wipe in a zig-zag motion when cleaning large areas, such as entire panels.

Use isopropyl alcohol wipes (such as those used to clean glasses or screens) to clean away small stains.

NOTE: Tesla does not recommend taking Cybertruck through an automatic car wash.

## Cleaning Mud

If your vehicle is covered in mud, such as after off-roading, rinse the entire exterior of the vehicle with water. It is important to regularly clean the exterior of Cybertruck after off-roading because mud and debris can quickly build up and limit some vehicle functions.

For certain components, such as the underside, wheel wells, panel seams, and radiator, use a power washer to remove stuck-on mud or debris. Then follow the rest of the regular cleaning on page 191 steps, as explained above. Wipe away mud from the headlights, tail lights, and cameras, as it may affect your vehicle's ability to drive safely.

Mud and rocks can get trapped between the wheel cover and wheel well. This may cause noise or vibration. Remember to clear mud, dirt, and rocks from the wheel wells after off-roading.

> CAUTION: Damage to the vehicle as a result of debris or mud buildup is not covered by the warranty.
---
# Cleaning

## Window Cleaning and Treatments

Clean windows and mirrors using an automotive glass cleaner. Do not scrape or use any abrasive cleaning fluid on glass or mirrored surfaces. Follow the directions in Cleaning the Exterior on page 191 for best practices in cleaning the exterior glass.

To add a hydrophobic coating to your vehicle's windows, apply the coating only to the side and rear windows, not the front windshield—doing so may affect the visibility of the autopilot cameras. Follow the hydrophobic coating manufacturer's instructions for application details.

NOTE: Tesla is not responsible for any damage associated with applying window treatments on your vehicle.

## Car Wash

If taking Cybertruck to an automatic car wash is necessary, Car Wash Mode closes all windows, locks the charge port, and disables windshield wipers, Sentry Mode, and walk-away door locking. To enable, touch Controls > Car Wash. Your vehicle must be stationary and not actively charging.

If using an automatic car wash, Enable Free Roll keeps your vehicle in Neutral and activates free roll for the duration of the wash, while preventing Cybertruck from applying the Parking brake if you leave the driver's seat. To enable, press on the brake pedal and touch Enable Free Roll; or shift into Neutral.

Car Wash Mode disables if the vehicle's speed exceeds 9 mph (15 km/h) or by touching Exit on the touchscreen.

CAUTION: Failure to put Cybertruck in Car Wash Mode may result in damage (for example, to the charge port or windshield wipers). Damage caused by car washes is not covered by the warranty.

## Cautions for Exterior Cleaning

- CAUTION: Do not wash in direct sunlight.
- CAUTION: Do not use windshield treatment fluids. Doing so can interfere with wiper friction and cause a chattering sound.
- CAUTION: Do not use hot water, detergents, highly alkaline or caustic cleaning ingredients or solvents, specifically those containing hydroxide.
- CAUTION: If using a pressure washer, maintain a distance of at least 12" (30 cm) between the nozzle and the surface of Cybertruck. Keep the nozzle moving and do not concentrate the water jet on any one area.
- CAUTION: Do not aim water hoses directly at windows, door, or hood seals or at electronic modules or exposed cabling.

CAUTION: To avoid corrosive damage that may not be covered by the warranty, rinse away any road salt from the underside of the vehicle, wheel wells, and brakes. After cleaning the vehicle, dry the brakes by going on a short drive and applying the brakes multiple times.

CAUTION: Avoid using tight-napped or rough cloths, such as washing mitts. A high-quality microfiber cleaning cloth is recommended.

CAUTION: If washing in an automatic car wash, use touchless car washes only. These car washes have no parts (brushes, etc.) that touch the surfaces of Cybertruck. Some touchless car washes use caustic solutions that, over time, can cause discoloration of decorative exterior trim. Avoid exposure to soaps and chemicals above pH 13. If unsure, check the product label or ask the staff at the car wash. Damage caused by improper washing is not covered by the warranty.

CAUTION: If washing in an automatic car wash, make sure the vehicle is locked. In addition, avoid using controls on the touchscreen that can result in accidentally opening doors or trunks while the vehicle is being washed. Any damage caused is not covered by the warranty.

CAUTION: Ensure the wipers are off before washing Cybertruck to avoid the risk of damaging the wipers.

CAUTION: Do not use chemical based wheel cleaners or pre-wash products. These can damage the finish on the wheels.

WARNING: Never spray liquid at a high velocity (for example, if using a pressure washer) towards the charge port while Cybertruck is charging. Failure to follow these instructions can result in serious injury or damage to the vehicle, charging equipment, or property.

## Cleaning the Interior

Frequently inspect and clean the interior to maintain its appearance and to prevent premature wear. If possible, immediately wipe up spills and remove marks. For general cleaning, wipe interior surfaces using a soft cloth (such as microfiber) dampened with a mixture of warm water and mild non-detergent cleaner (test all cleaners on a concealed area before use). To avoid streaks, dry immediately with a soft lint-free cloth.

### Interior Glass

Do not scrape, or use any abrasive cleaning fluid on glass or mirrored surfaces. This can damage the reflective surface of the mirror and the heating elements in the rear window.

### Airbags

Do not allow any substance to enter an airbag cover. This could affect correct operation.

# Cleaning

## Dashboard and Plastic Surfaces

Do not polish the upper surfaces of the dashboard. Polished surfaces are reflective and could interfere with your driving view.

For general spills and stains, wipe spills and chemical residues from interior surfaces as soon as possible. Moisten a soft cloth (preferably microfiber) with warm water and mild soap and gently wipe the stain in a circular motion. Then, wipe dry using a soft, lint-free cloth. Do not blow dry. Anything more than soap can be too harsh. Using other cleaning agents, disinfectants, conditioners, or protectants is not recommended.

## Interior Lighting

NOTE: The Tesla warranty does not cover damage caused by improper maintenance, including the use of cleaning solutions or tools that are not recommended in this Owner's Manual.

Do not use any soap or chemical cleaning solutions on interior lighting. Common cleaning solutions and substances can degrade the lenses or components of the lighting, causing cracks and damage over time. When you want to clean interior lighting, Tesla recommends that you use a soft cloth moistened with warm water to gently wipe away soiled areas or stains. Interior lighting includes, but is not limited to, these lights (if equipped):

- Footwell
- Puddle
- Projection
- Dome
- Accent
- Ambient

When you want to clean the interior with soap or a mild non-detergent cleaner, Tesla recommends that you first cover all lighting with some form of protection, such as:

- Fabric.
- Masking tape.
- Plastic film.
- Protective covers for car interiors.

## Seats

NOTE: The Tesla warranty does not cover damage caused by improper maintenance, including the use of cleaning solutions or tools that are not recommended in this Owner's Manual.

Your vehicle's seats are made of a custom, sustainable, vegan leather which is softer than leather, yet far more durable and stain resistant. Tesla recommends that you regularly clean and vacuum the interior of your vehicle to maintain performance and an as-new appearance. You can purchase an all-purpose cleaning kit on the Tesla Shop.

Avoid contact with harsh chemicals, including certain cosmetics. Such substances can cause damage, degradation, or discoloration over time.

For white seats: As a last resort, moisten a soft cloth (such as microfiber) with warm water and isopropyl alcohol and gently wipe the stain in a circular motion (DO NOT use this method on black seats). Clean off any remaining isopropyl alcohol residue with a soft, damp cloth. Aggressive or extended use of isopropyl alcohol will damage the top coat of the material, allowing stains to occur more readily and violating the warranty.

> CAUTION: Do not use products containing alcohol, bleach (sodium hypoclorite), citrus, naptha, or silicon-based additives. Do not spray the seat directly with any spray. Do not get water into the seat belt mechanism.

A variety of clothing, accessories, and cosmetics may contain dyes or oils which can transfer onto the seats over time. These stains are difficult to prevent and cannot always be safely cleaned off.

> CAUTION: Do not use aftermarket, non-Tesla seat covers. Seat covers may cause staining or damage to the seats and may inhibit the sensitivity of a seat's occupancy sensors or restrict deployment of airbags.

## Carpets

Avoid over-wetting carpets. For heavily soiled areas, use a diluted upholstery cleaner.

## Seat Belts

Extend the belts to wipe. Do not use any type of detergent or chemical cleaning agent. Allow the belts to dry naturally while extended, preferably away from direct sunlight.

## Door Seals

Wipe door seals with a damp cloth to remove any debris. Excessive debris on the door seals can cause damage when contacting surrounding surfaces. Avoid using alcohol wipes or any chemical products that can potentially deteriorate the coating on the door seals.

## Front and Rear Touchscreens

Clean the touchscreen(s) using a soft lint-free cloth specifically designed to clean monitors and displays. Do not use cleaners (such as a glass cleaner) or alcohol-based gel products (such as hand sanitizer) and do not use a wet wipe or a dry statically-charged cloth (such as a recently washed microfiber). To wipe the front touchscreen without activating buttons and changing settings, you can enable Screen Clean

## Metal Surfaces

Polish, abrasive cleaners, alcohol-based gel products (such as hand sanitizer), and hard cloths can damage the finish on metal surfaces.

## Cautions for Interior Cleaning

⚠️ CAUTION: Using solvents (including alcohol), alcohol-based gel products (such as hand sanitizer), bleach, citrus, naphtha, or silicone-based products or additives on interior components can cause damage.

⚠️ CAUTION: Statically-charged materials can cause damage to the touchscreen.

⚠️ WARNING: If you notice any damage on an airbag or seat belt, contact Tesla immediately.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not allow any water, cleaners, or fabric to enter a seat belt mechanism.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not use solvents or soap on interior accent lights.

⚠️ WARNING: Exposure to chemical cleaners can be hazardous and can irritate eyes and skin. Read and observe the instructions provided by the manufacturer of the chemical cleaner.

## Floor Mats

To extend the life of your carpet and make them easier to clean, use genuine Tesla floor mats available online at http://www.tesla.com. Maintain floor mats by regularly cleaning them and checking that they are properly attached. Replace floor mats if they become excessively worn.

⚠️ WARNING: To avoid potential interference with a foot pedal, ensure that the driver's floor mat is securely fastened, and never place an additional floor mat on top of it. Floor mats should always rest on top of the vehicle carpeting surface and not on another floor mat or other covering.

## Using a Car Cover

To preserve the cosmetic appearance of the body when Cybertruck is not being used, use a genuine Tesla car cover. Car covers can be purchased online from the Tesla Shop.

[A simple line drawing of a Cybertruck covered with a car cover]

⚠️ CAUTION: Use only a Tesla-approved car cover when Cybertruck is plugged in. Using a non-Tesla car cover can prevent the Battery from being adequately cooled during charging.

# Tire Pressures

## Displaying Tire Pressures

Tire pressures display on the touchscreen by touching Controls > Service, or use the mobile app. The pressure of each tire displays in the visualization of Cybertruck, in addition to the time the tire pressures were last read by the system.

The touchscreen also displays your vehicle's recommended cold tire pressures so you can easily determine how much to inflate your tires.

To choose whether to display tire pressures using Bar or PSI, touch Controls > Display > Tire Pressure.

NOTE: You may need to drive briefly before the visualization displays the tire pressure values.

## Maintaining Tire Pressures

[An image shows the interior of a vehicle door, with a blue arrow pointing to a label on the door frame]

Keep tires inflated to the recommended pressures, even if it differs from the pressure printed on the tire itself. The Tire and Loading Information label on the center door pillar is visible when the driver door is open and represents a nominal driving scenario in which the vehicle is carrying cargo in the front trunk and up to five passengers. When carrying heavy loads, up to the vehicle's GVWR, in a Cybertruck equipped with All Terrain tires, the tire pressures should be increased.

| Tires (Front and Rear) | Normal Load* | GVWR** |
|------------------------|--------------|--------|
| 20" All Season         | 50 psi       | 50 psi |
| 20" All Terrain        | 50 psi       | 65 psi |

*Normal Load assumes a fully loaded front trunk and up to five occupants (see Steps for Determining the Correct Load Limit on page 219).

**GVWR load capacity not exceeding the vehicle's Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (see Weights - Vehicle on page 223).

⚠️ CAUTION: If you are towing a trailer, do not use the tire pressures printed on the Tire and Loading Information Label. Instead, refer to the tire pressures published (see Tire Pressures when Towing on page 111).

The Low Tire Pressure indicator light on the touchscreen alerts you if a tire is under-inflated. This light does not immediately turn off when you adjust tire pressure. After inflating the tire to the recommended pressure, you must drive over 15 mph (25 km/h) for a short amount of time to activate the Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), which turns off the Low Tire Pressure indicator light.

If the indicator light flashes for one minute whenever you power on Cybertruck, a fault with the TPMS is detected.

Your vehicle's tire pressures will drop in cold ambient temperatures. If the TPMS indicator light appears, inflate the tires before driving. The tires will lose approximately one PSI for every 10° F (6° C) drop in outside temperature. Proper tire pressures help protect tires from potholes and improve range and tire longevity when properly inflated.

⚠️ WARNING: The Low Tire Pressure indicator light alerts you only in situations when a tire is below the recommended threshold (as indicated on the Tire and Loading Information label) under normal driving conditions. It does not alert you when a tire is under-inflated based on the load you are carrying.

⚠️ WARNING: Under-inflation is the most common cause of tire failures and can cause a tire to overheat, resulting in severe tire cracking, tread separation, or blowout. This may lead to unexpected loss of vehicle control and increased risk of injury. Under-inflation also reduces the vehicle's range and tire tread life.

## Checking and Adjusting Tire Pressures

⚠️ WARNING: Check tire pressures using an accurate pressure gauge when tires are cold. It takes only about one mile (1.6 km) of driving to warm up the tires sufficiently to affect tire pressures. Parking the vehicle in direct sunlight or in hot weather can also affect tire pressures. If you must check warm tires, expect increased pressures. Do not let air out of warm tires in an attempt to match recommended cold tire pressures. A hot tire at or below the recommended cold tire inflation pressure is dangerously under-inflated.

Maintenance 195

# Tire Pressures

Follow these steps when tires are cold and Cybertruck has been stationary for over three hours:

1. Refer to the Tire and Loading Information label located on the driver's center door pillar for the target tire pressure.
2. Remove the wheel cover (see Removing and Installing Wheel Covers on page 199).
3. Remove the valve cap.
4. Firmly press an accurate tire pressure gauge onto the valve to measure pressure.

NOTE: You can also view tire pressures on the touchscreen.

![Image showing a hand using a tire pressure gauge on a vehicle tire]

5. If required, add or remove air to reach the recommended pressure.

NOTE: You can release air by pressing the metal stem in the center of the valve.

6. Re-check pressure using the accurate tire gauge.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 as necessary until the tire pressure is correct.
8. Reinstall the valve cap to prevent dirt from entering. Periodically check the valve for damage and leaks.
9. Reinstall the wheel cover.

## Tire Pressure Monitoring

The Cybertruck is equipped with a tire pressure monitoring system that warns the driver of significant under-inflation or over-inflation of the tires by displaying the Tire Pressure Indicator Light. Check the Tire Information label located on the driver's door pillar for more details, or see Maintaining Tire Pressures on page 195.

Each tire, including the spare (if provided), should be checked monthly when cold and inflated to the inflation pressure recommended by the vehicle manufacturer on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label. (If your vehicle has tires of a different size than the size indicated on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label, you should determine the proper tire inflation pressure for those tires.)

As an added safety feature, your vehicle has been equipped with a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) that illuminates a low tire pressure telltale when one or more of your tires is significantly under-inflated. Accordingly, when the low tire pressure telltale illuminates, you should stop and check your tires as soon as possible, and inflate them to the proper pressure. Driving on a significantly under-inflated tire causes the tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure. Under-inflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tire tread life, and may affect the vehicle's handling and stopping ability.

Please note that the TPMS is not a substitute for proper tire maintenance, and it is the driver's responsibility to maintain correct tire pressure, even if under-inflation has not reached the level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire pressure telltale.

## TPMS Malfunction

Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS malfunction indicator to indicate when the system is not operating properly. The TPMS malfunction indicator is combined with the low tire pressure telltale. When the system detects a malfunction, the telltale will flash for approximately one minute and then remain continuously illuminated. This sequence will continue upon subsequent vehicle start-ups as long as the malfunction exists.

When the malfunction indicator is illuminated, the system may not be able to detect or signal low tire pressure as intended. TPMS malfunctions may occur for a variety of reasons, including the installation of replacement or alternate tires or wheels on the vehicle that prevent the TPMS from functioning properly. Always check the TPMS malfunction telltale after replacing one or more tires or wheels on your vehicle to ensure that the replacement or alternate tires and wheels allow the TPMS to continue to function properly.

The TPMS malfunction indicator is combined with the tire pressure indicator light. If Cybertruck detects a fault with the TPMS, this indicator flashes for one minute whenever you power on Cybertruck.

NOTE: Installing accessories that are not approved by Tesla can interfere with the TPMS.

NOTE: If a tire has been replaced or repaired using a different tire sealant than the one available from Tesla, and a low tire pressure is detected, it is possible that the tire sensor has been damaged.

# Inspecting and Maintaining Tires

Regularly inspect the tread and side walls for any sign of distortion (bulges), foreign objects, cuts or wear.

If tire wear is uneven (on one side of the tire only) or becomes abnormally excessive, check the wheel alignment.

> WARNING: Do not drive Cybertruck if a tire is damaged, excessively worn, or inflated to an incorrect pressure. Check tires regularly for wear, and ensure there are no cuts, bulges or exposure of the ply/cord structure.

To improve the mileage you get from your tires, maintain tires at the recommended tire pressures, observe speed limits and advisory speeds, and avoid:

- Pulling away quickly, or hard acceleration.
- Fast turns and heavy braking.
- Potholes and objects in the road.
- Hitting curbs when parking.
- Contaminating tires with fluids that can cause damage.

## Tire Wear

Adequate tread depth is important for proper tire performance.

Cybertruck is originally fitted with tires that have wear indicators molded into the tread pattern. When the tread has been worn down to 2/32" (1.6 mm), the indicators start to appear at the surface of the tread pattern, producing the effect of a continuous band of rubber across the width of the tire. For optimal performance and safety, Tesla recommends replacing tires before the wear indicators are visible.

Tires with a tread depth less than 4/32" (3 mm) are more likely to hydroplane and should not be used when driving in wet conditions. Tires with a tread depth less than 5/32" (4 mm) do not perform well in snow and slush and should not be used when driving in winter conditions.

To improve vehicle handling characteristics and minimize hydroplaning in wet conditions, put tires with the most tread on the rear of the car.

## Punctured Tires

A puncture eventually causes the tire to lose pressure, which is why it is important to check tire pressures frequently. Permanently repair (if safe to do so) or replace punctured or damaged tires as soon as possible.

Your tubeless tires may not leak when penetrated, provided the object remains in the tire. If, however, you feel a sudden vibration or ride disturbance while driving, or you suspect a tire is damaged, immediately reduce your speed. Drive slowly, while avoiding heavy braking or sharp steering and, when safe to do so, stop the vehicle and contact Roadside Assistance.

NOTE: In some cases, you can temporarily repair small tire punctures (under 1/4" (6 mm)) using an optional tire repair kit available from Tesla. This allows you to slowly drive Cybertruck to a nearby tire repair facility.

> WARNING: Do not drive with a punctured tire that has not been repaired, even if the puncture has not caused the tire to deflate. A punctured tire can deflate suddenly at any time.

## Flat Spots

If Cybertruck is stationary for a long period, tires can form flat spots. When Cybertruck is driven, these flat spots cause a vibration which gradually disappears as the tires warm up and regain their original shape.

To minimize flat spots during storage, inflate tires to the maximum pressure indicated on the tire's sidewall. Then, before driving, release air to adjust tire pressure to the recommended levels.

## Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)

After replacing one or more wheels (but not after just replacing a tire or rotating wheels), the TPMS sensors are reset to ensure tire pressure warnings are accurate. TPMS sensors reset automatically after driving over 15 mph (25 km/h) for longer than 10 minutes.

NOTE: After replacing a wheel, false tire pressure warnings may display before you've driven 15 mph (25 km/h) for longer than 10 minutes.

> WARNING: If your Cybertruck is equipped with aftermarket tires that differ in size from those printed on the Tire and Loading Information Label (see Vehicle Loading on page 218), it is the driver's responsibility to determine the correct tire pressure. Do not drive on public roads when tires are not inflated to the correct pressure.

## Tire Rotation, Balance, and Wheel Alignment

Tesla recommends rotating the tires every 6,250 miles (10,000 km) or if tread depth difference is 2/32 in (1.6 mm) or greater, whichever comes first.

Tire rotation is an essential part of tire maintenance. It helps maintain an even tread wear pattern which enhances the tire's overall wear quality, decreases road noise and maximizes tire life.

Unbalanced wheels (sometimes noticeable as vibration through the steering wheel) affect vehicle handling and tire life. Even with regular use, wheels can get out of balance. Therefore, they should be balanced as required.
---
# Inspecting and Maintaining Tires

⚠️ WARNING: Do not depend on TPMS sensors to accurately determine pressures and trigger alerts. It is the driver's responsibility to maintain correct tire pressures (see Maintaining Tire Pressures on page 195). Over or under-inflated tires can result in loss of control or tire damage, which can lead to serious injury.

## TPMS Malfunction

Cybertruck has also been equipped with a TPMS malfunction indicator to indicate when the system is not operating properly.

The TPMS malfunction indicator is combined with the tire pressure indicator light. When the system detects a malfunction, the indicator flashes for approximately one minute, then remains continuously lit. This sequence continues upon subsequent vehicle start-ups as long as the malfunction exists. When the TPMS malfunction indicator is on, the system might not be able to detect or signal under-inflated tires as intended.

TPMS malfunctions can occur for a variety of reasons, including installing replacement or alternate tires or wheels that prevent the TPMS from functioning properly. Always check the TPMS malfunction indicator light after replacing one or more tires or wheels on your vehicle to ensure that the replacement tires or wheels allow the TPMS to continue to function properly.

NOTE: If a tire has been replaced or repaired using a different tire sealant than the one available from Tesla, and a low tire pressure is detected, it is possible that the tire sensor has been damaged. Use the mobile app to schedule a service appointment to have the fault repaired as soon as possible.

### Replacing a Tire Sensor

If the Tire Pressure warning indicator displays frequently, schedule a service appointment to determine if a tire sensor needs to be replaced. Non-Tesla Service Center must replace using a Tesla OEM sensor.

## Seasonal Tire Types

### Understand Your Tire Type

The type of tires that your vehicle is originally equipped with depends on vehicle model and market region. It is important to understand the capabilities of your vehicle's tires and whether they are suited for summer, all-season, or winter driving. Check the information on the sidewall of a tire for information about a tire's performance characteristics (see Tire Pressures on page 195).

## Summer and All-Season Tires

Summer tires and all season tires are designed for maximum dry and wet road performance but are not designed to perform well in winter conditions. All-season tires are designed to provide adequate traction in most conditions year-round, but may not provide the same level of traction as winter tires in snowy or icy conditions. All-season tires can be identified by "ALL SEASON" and/or "M+S" (mud and snow) on the tire sidewall.

If driving in cold temperatures or on roads where snow or ice may be present, Tesla recommends using winter tires.

⚠️ WARNING: In cold temperatures or on snow or ice, summer and all-season tires do not provide adequate traction. Selecting and installing the appropriate tires for winter conditions is important to ensure the safety and optimum performance of your Cybertruck.

## All-Terrain Tires

Use all-terrain tires if you regularly drive on gravel and dirt roads. All-terrain tires are suitable for driving on both paved roads (city streets, highways, etc.) as well as off-road (sand, dirt, mud, etc.). All-terrain tires must be the same diameter, brand, construction and tread pattern on all four wheels.

When driving with all-terrain tires, you may experience more road noise, shorter tread life, and less traction on dry roads.

## Winter Tires

Use winter tires to increase traction in snowy or icy conditions. When installing winter tires, always install a complete set of four tires at the same time. Winter tires must be the same diameter, brand, construction and tread pattern on all four wheels.

Winter tires can be identified by a mountain/snowflake symbol on the tire's sidewall.

When driving with winter tires, you may experience more road noise and shorter tread life.

⚠️ WARNING: Never exceed the speed rating of your vehicle's tires. The speed rating is shown on the sidewall of your tires (see Understanding Tire Markings on page 202).

## Driving in Low Temperatures

Tire performance is reduced in low ambient temperatures, resulting in reduced grip and an increased susceptibility to damage from impacts. Performance tires (summer applications) have reduced traction in ambient temperatures below 5° C40° F (5° C), and are not recommended in
---
# Inspecting and Maintaining Tires

snow/ice conditions. Performance tires can temporarily harden when cold, causing you to hear rotational noise for the first few miles (kilometers) until the tires warm up.

## Tire Chains

Only use tire chains on the REAR tires.

Tesla has tested and approved the following tire chains to increase traction in snowy conditions. Install tire chains on rear tires only. You can purchase these tire chains from Tesla or other distributors.

> CAUTION: You must remove wheel covers before installing tire chains. Failure to do so can cause damage not covered by the warranty.

| Tire Size | Recommended Chain |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 20"       | König XD-16 Pro size 285 |

Tesla recommends that you use the size 285 König XD-16 Pro tire chains, as they are sized to match the tires on Cybertruck.

When installing tire chains, follow the instructions and warnings provided by the tire chain manufacturer. Mount them evenly and as tight as possible.

When using tire chains:

- Inspect the tire chains for loose fittings and damaged links before each use.
- Set air suspension to Medium and turn off the Preferred Ride Height to Low setting (see Suspension on page 92).
- Avoid heavily loading Cybertruck (heavy loads can reduce the clearance between the tires and the body).
- Do not drive the vehicle without the chains properly installed.
- Drive slowly. Do not exceed 30 mph (48 km/h).
- Remove the tire chains as soon as conditions allow.

NOTE: Tire chains are prohibited in some jurisdictions. Check local laws before installing tire chains.

> CAUTION: Using non-recommended tire chains, or using tire chains on other sized tires can damage the suspension, body, wheels, and/or brake lines. Damage caused by using non-recommended tire chains, or incorrectly installing tire chains, is not covered by the warranty.

> CAUTION: Never deflate your tires to put on tire chains. When re-inflated, the chains might fit too tightly and cause tire damage.

> CAUTION: Install tire chains on rear tires only. Installing chains on front tires can cause damage.

> CAUTION: Ensure that the tire chains cannot touch suspension components or brake lines. If you hear the chains making unusual noises that would indicate contact with Cybertruck, stop and investigate immediately.

## Removing and Installing Wheel Covers

If your Cybertruck is equipped with wheel covers, you must remove them to access the valve stem and the lug nuts.

To remove a wheel cover:

1. Grasp the cover firmly with both hands.
2. Pull the cover toward you to release the retaining clips.

[Image of a wheel with an arrow indicating the direction to pull the wheel cover]

NOTE: Make sure the mounting ring is removed with the wheel cover.

To install a wheel cover:

1. Separate the mounting ring from the wheel cover by pulling the platic ring from the inside of the wheel cover.

# Wheel and Tire Specifications

## Understanding Tire Markings

Laws require tire manufacturers to place standardized information on the sidewall of all tires. This information identifies and describes the fundamental characteristics of the tire. It also provides the tire identification number (TIN) for certification of safety standards, and in case of a recall.

[A detailed image of a tire with numbered labels pointing to various parts of the tire and its markings. The numbers range from 1 to 15, indicating different aspects of the tire's specifications.]

NOTE: You can identify a Tesla-approved tire by the "T-mark" specification on the tire's sidewall (for example, T0, T1, T2).Tesla-approved tires are designed to work with your vehicle and optimize performance, safety, reliability, and durability. For more information about Tesla-approved replacement tires, refer to the Service Manual.

1. Tire category: P (passenger), LT (light truck), or None (hard metric) indicates the tire classification and corresponding load classification.

2. Tire width: This 3-digit number is the width (in millimeters) of the tire from sidewall edge to sidewall edge.

3. Aspect ratio: This 2-digit number is the sidewall height as a percentage of the tread width. So, if the tread width is 205 mm, and the aspect ratio is 50, the sidewall height is 102 mm.

4. Tire construction: R indicates that the tire is of Radial ply construction.

5. Wheel diameter: This 2-digit number is the diameter of the wheel rim in inches.

6. Load index: This 2 or 3-digit number is the weight each tire can support. This number is not always shown.

202                                                                                                                                Owner's Manual

# Wheel and Tire Specifications

7. **Speed rating:** When stated, indicates the maximum speed (in mph) at which the tire can be used for extended periods.
   Q=99 mph (160 km/h), R=106 mph (170 km/h), S=112 mph (180 km/h), T=118 mph (190 km/h), U=124 mph (200 km/h),
   H=130 mph (210 km/h), V=149 mph (240 km/h), W=168 mph (270 km/h), Y=186 mph (300 km/h), (Y)=vehicle's top speed
   (exceeds the "Y" rating).

8. **Load range:** Shown as Standard Load (SL) or Extra Load (XL), the load range determines how much weight your tires can
   support at a specified tire pressure. When replacing tires, only use tires of the same load range. If towing with snow tires,
   ensure they are the same load range of the tires your vehicle came equipped with.

9. **Tire composition and materials:** The number of plies in both the tread area and the sidewall area indicates how many layers
   of rubber coated material make up the structure of the tire. Information is also provided on the type of materials used.

10. **Maximum tire load:** The maximum load which can be carried by the tire.

11. **Maximum permissible inflation pressure:** This pressure should not be used for normal driving.

12. **U.S. DOT Tire Identification Number (TIN):** Begins with the letters DOT and indicates that the tire meets all federal
    standards. The next 2 digits/letters represent the plant code where it was manufactured, and the last 4 digits represent the
    week and year of manufacture. For example, the number 1712 is used to represent the 17th week of 2012. The other
    numbers are marketing codes used at the manufacturer's discretion. This information can be used to contact consumers if
    a tire defect requires a recall.

13. **Treadwear grade:** This number indicates the tire's wear rate. The higher the treadwear number is, the longer it should take
    for the tread to wear down. A tire rated at 400, for example, lasts twice as long as a tire rated at 200.

14. **Traction grade:** Indicates a tire's ability to stop on wet roads. A higher graded tire should allow you to stop your vehicle in a
    shorter distance than a tire with a lower grade. Traction is graded from highest to lowest as AA, A, B, and C.

## Uniform Tire Quality Grading

The following information relates to the tire grading system developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which grades tires by tread wear, traction and temperature performance. Tires that have deep tread, and winter tires, are exempt from these marking requirements.

Where applicable, quality grades are found on the tire's sidewall between the tread shoulder and maximum section width. For example:

- TREADWEAR 180
- TRACTION AA
- TEMPERATURE A

The quality grades are described next.

NOTE: In addition to the marking requirements, passenger car tires must conform to Federal Safety Requirements.

### Treadwear

The treadwear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test course.

For example, a tire graded 150 wears one and a half times better on a government test course than a tire graded 100. The relative performance of tires depends on the actual conditions of their use, however, and can depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices, road characteristics, and climate.

### Traction

The traction grades, from highest to lowest, are: AA, A, B, and C. These grades represent a tire's ability to stop on wet pavement as measured under controlled conditions on test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire marked C might have poor traction performance.

⚠️ WARNING: Defective tires are dangerous. Do not drive if a tire is damaged, excessively worn, or is inflated to an incorrect pressure. The safety of the vehicle and occupants can be adversely affected. Check tires regularly for wear and to ensure there are no cuts, bulges or exposure of the ply/cord structure.

⚠️ WARNING: The traction grade assigned to the tire is based on straight-ahead braking tests, and does not include: acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning or peak traction characteristics.

### Temperature

The temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel. Sustained high temperature can cause the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure.

The grade C corresponds to the minimum level of performance that all passenger car tires must meet under the Federal Motor Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A represent levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel that exceed the minimum requirements.

⚠️ WARNING: A tire's temperature grade is established for a tire that is properly inflated and not overloaded. Excessive speed, under-inflation, or excessive loading, either separately or in combination, can cause heat buildup and possible tire failure.

# Windshield Wiper Blade, Jets and Fluid

## Topping Up Windshield Washer Fluid

The only reservoir into which you can add fluid is the windshield washer fluid reservoir, which is located behind the powered frunk liner. When the level is low, a message displays on the touchscreen.

To top up the washer fluid:

1. Open the powered frunk.
2. Use a microfiber cloth to clean around the filler cap before opening it to prevent dirt from entering the reservoir.
3. Open the filler cap.
4. While avoiding spilling, fill the reservoir until the fluid level is visible just below the filler neck. The reservoir has a total capacity of 4.2 liters.

[An image shows the windshield washer fluid reservoir with a blue highlight around the filler cap]

5. Wipe up any spills immediately and wash the affected area with water.
6. Close the filler cap.

⚠️ CAUTION: Some national or local regulations restrict the use of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). VOCs are commonly used as freeze protection in washer fluid. Use a washer fluid with limited VOC content only if it provides adequate freeze resistance for all climates in which you drive Cybertruck.

⚠️ CAUTION: Use only ethanol-based windshield washer fluid meant for automotive vehicles. Using other substances, such as untreated water, can result in bacterial growth within the climate control system resulting in odor or potential damage that is not covered by warranty. Untreated pure water expands to ice when freezing, which may result in damage.

⚠️ CAUTION: Do not add formulated washer fluids that contain water repellent or bug wash. These fluids can cause streaking, smearing, and squeaking or other noises.

⚠️ WARNING: In temperatures below -32° F (0° C), use a washer fluid with antifreeze. In cold weather, using a washer fluid without antifreeze can impair visibility through the windshield.

⚠️ WARNING: Windshield washer fluid can irritate eyes and skin. Read and observe the instructions provided by the washer fluid manufacturer.

## Cleaning the Wiper Blade

Periodically clean the edge of the wiper blade and check the rubber for cracks, splits, and roughness. If damaged, replace the blade immediately to prevent damage to the glass and improve visibility.

Contaminants on the windshield or wiper blade can reduce the effectiveness of the wiper. Contaminants include ice, wax spray from car washes, washer fluid with bug and/or water repellent, bird droppings, tree sap, and other organic substances.

Follow these guidelines for cleaning:

1. Lift the wiper arm a short distance away from the windshield, just far enough to access the wiper blade. Do not lift the wiper arm beyond its intended position.
2. Place a towel between the wiper arm and windshield to avoid scratching or cracking the windshield.
3. Clean the windshield and wiper blade using washer fluid or non-abrasive glass cleaner approved for use on automotive glass and rubber.

   ⚠️ CAUTION: Inappropriate products can cause damage or smears and create glare on the windshield.

4. Gently place the wiper blade back onto the windshield.
5. Test the wiper blade again. If the wiper remains ineffective after cleaning, replace the wiper blade.

NOTE: An ineffective wiper can lead to reduced visibility for the front windshield cameras, which may lead to degraded performance or unavailability of Autopilot features. For more information, see Cameras on page 27 and refer to Autopilot Limitations and Warnings on page 138.

## Replacing the Wiper Blade

For optimum performance, replace the wiper blade at least once a year. You can purchase a replacement wiper blade on the Tesla Shop.

⚠️ CAUTION: Only install a replacement blade that is identical to the original blade. Using an inappropriate blade can damage the wiper system and windshield.

To replace the wiper blade:

1. Shift into Park and turn off the wiper. Ensure the wiper setting is Off and not in Auto, because the wiper blade may still sweep if there is any liquid detected on the windshield.
2. Place a towel between the wiper arm and windshield to avoid scratching or cracking the windshield.
3. Lift the wiper arm a short distance away from the windshield, just far enough to access the wiper blade.

7. Align the new wiper blade on the wiper arm and slide it toward the base of the wiper arm until it locks into place.

8. Ensure the wiper blade is fully secured by lightly pushing and pulling on the blade. The blade should not jostle or move around.

⚠️ CAUTION: Ensure the new blade is locked in place and does not move. If not locked in place (you can hear and feel a "click"), the wiper blade may come off during use, resulting in serious damage.

5. Disconnect the washer hose from the wiper blade by pulling the hose from the barb fitting.

9. Remove the towel and gently place the wiper blade against the windshield.

## Washer Jets

The windshield washer fluid sprays from nozzles along the length of the wiper blade. You cannot adjust them. If a windshield washer nozzle becomes blocked, use a thin strand of wire to clear any blockages.

If the blade is not dispensing washer fluid, make sure there is enough wiper fluid in the reservoir and refill if needed. If this issue still persists, check the hose connection between the arm and blade for any leaks, kinks, or disconnections.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not operate the washers while cleaning Cybertruck. Windshield washer fluid can irritate eyes and skin. Read and observe the washer fluid manufacturer's instructions for safe handling.

6. Connect the new washer hose to the barb fitting on the new wiper blade.

# Vehicle Loading

It is important to understand your vehicle's original tire sizes and pressures, and the GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating) and GAWR (Gross Axle Weight Rating). This information can be found on two labels attached to the front door pillar on the driver's side of the vehicle.

[An image shows the interior of a vehicle door with two labels indicated]

1. Tire and Loading Information Label
2. Vehicle Certification Label

Never change this label, even if you use different tires in the future.

NOTE: If Cybertruck is loaded to its full capacity, double check all tires to ensure they are inflated to their recommended pressure levels (see Maintaining Tire Pressures on page 195).

⚠️ WARNING: Tire pressures printed on the Tire and Loading Information label DO NOT APPLY to towing. When towing, tire pressures must be increased. For information about the tire pressures required when towing, refer to see Towing a Trailer on page 110.

## Vehicle Certification Label

⚠️ WARNING: The Vehicle Certification label specifies the weight ratings for Cybertruck based on the tires that were installed at time of manufacture and the tire pressures indicated on the Tire and Loading Information label. However, the weight ratings will change if you change the factory-installed tires or inflate tires to a pressure that differs from those shown on the Tire and Loading Information label.

⚠️ WARNING: Overloading Cybertruck has an adverse effect on braking and handling, which can compromise your safety or cause damage.

⚠️ CAUTION: Never store large amounts of liquid in Cybertruck. A significant spill can cause electrical components to malfunction.

The Vehicle Certification label provides:

- GVWR - Gross Vehicle Weight Rating. The maximum allowable total mass of Cybertruck. This is calculated as the weight of Cybertruck equipped with the heaviest factory selectable options, all passengers, fluids, and cargo.
- GAWR FRT and GAWR RR - Gross Axle Weight Rating for the front and rear axles. The GAWR is the maximum distributed weight that each axle can support.

# Vehicle Loading

## Roof Racks

Cybertruck supports the use of Tesla-approved roof racks. Roof racks can be installed over the roof, over the bed, or both. To install roof racks, you must use only roof rack systems that have been approved by Tesla. You can find the roof rack instructions in the box or on the Tesla Shop.

Maximum Load on Roof Racks: 220 lb (100 kg) per 2-crossbar set. For example, a 2-crossbar set placed on the roof has a maximum load of 220 lb. An additional 2-crossbar set placed over the cargo bed also has a maximum load of 220 lb (100 kg).

[Image of a weight icon showing <220 lbs (100 kg) with arrows pointing to a partial image of a vehicle]

See Carrying Accessories and Crossbars on page 116 for more information.

> CAUTION: Failure to use the correct roof racks and follow the instructions can cause significant damage.

> WARNING: When loading the roof racks, distribute the load evenly and maintain a low center of gravity. Loaded vehicles, with higher centers of gravity, may handle differently than unloaded vehicles. Take extra precautions, such as slower speeds and increased stopping distance, when driving heavily loaded roof racks.

## Steps for Determining the Correct Load Limit

1. Locate the statement "The combined weight of occupants and cargo should never exceed XXX kg or XXX lbs." on your vehicle's placard.

2. Determine the combined weight of the driver and passengers that will be riding in your vehicle.

3. Subtract the combined weight of the driver and passengers from XXX kg or XXX lbs.

4. The resulting figure equals the available amount of cargo and luggage load capacity. For example, if the "XXX" amount equals 1400 lbs. and there will be five 150 lb passengers in your vehicle, the amount of available cargo and luggage load capacity is 650 lbs. (1400-750 (5 × 150) = 650 lbs.)

5. Determine the combined weight of luggage and cargo being loaded on the vehicle. That weight may not safely exceed the available cargo and luggage load capacity calculated in Step 4.

6. If your vehicle will be towing a trailer, load from your trailer will be transferred to your vehicle. Consult this manual to determine how this reduces the available cargo and luggage load capacity of your vehicle.

> WARNING: The powered frunk and the cargo bed are the preferred places to carry objects. In a collision, or during hard braking and sharp turns, loose items in the cabin could injure occupants.

## Example Load Limit Calculations

How much cargo Cybertruck can carry depends on the number and weight of passengers. The following calculated load limit examples assume passengers weigh 150 lbs (68 kg). If passengers weigh more or less, available cargo weight decreases or increases respectively.

### Driver and one passenger

| Description | Total |
|-------------|-------|
| Vehicle capacity weight | 954 lbs (433 kg) |
| Subtract occupant weight (2 x 150 lbs/68 kg) | 300 lbs (136 kg) |
| Available cargo weight | 654 lbs (297 kg) |

### Driver and four passengers

| Description | Total |
|-------------|-------|
| Vehicle capacity weight | 954 lbs (433 kg) |
| Subtract occupant weight (5 x 150 lbs/68 kg) | 750 lbs (340 kg) |
| Available cargo weight | 204 lbs (93 kg) |

## Cautions and Warnings

> WARNING: Drive cautiously when Cybertruck is carrying a large load. Increase braking distance, reduce speed when making sharp turns, and avoid abrupt steering. Failure to drive cautiously increases the risk of losing control which can result in property damage, personal injury, and death.

# Vehicle Loading

⚠️ WARNING: The loading capacity of your vehicle is limited either by how much space is available (volume capacity) or by how much weight the vehicle can carry (payload capacity). When you have loaded Cybertruck to its maximum weight capacity, do not add more cargo, even if there is space available. Overloading, or improper loading, can contribute to property damage, personal injury, or death.

# Instructions for Transporters

## DO NOT TRANSPORT WITH WHEELS ON THE GROUND

The front motor and rear motor(s) in Cybertruck may generate power when the wheels spin. Always transport Cybertruck with all four tires off the ground. Ensure that the tires are unable to spin at any time during transport.

⚠️ WARNING: NEVER TRANSPORT YOUR VEHICLE WITH THE TIRES IN A POSITION WHERE THEY CAN SPIN. DOING SO CAN LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE AND OVERHEATING. IN RARE CASES EXTREME OVERHEATING MAY CAUSE THE SURROUNDING COMPONENTS TO IGNITE.

[Image showing incorrect ways to transport a vehicle with wheels on the ground, marked with red X's]

Do not transport Cybertruck using any method that is not specified by Tesla. Adhere to the instructions provided here and observe all warnings and cautions. Damage caused by improper transporting of your vehicle is not covered by the warranty.

NOTE: Tesla is not liable or responsible for reimbursing services not dispatched through Tesla Roadside Assistance.

## Approved Methods for Transporting

A flatbed truck or comparable transport vehicle is the recommended method of transporting Cybertruck. Cybertruck can face either direction on the truck bed.

[Image of a flatbed truck carrying a Cybertruck]

⚠️ CAUTION: Use a flatbed truck with a bed that is at least 21 ft (6.5 meters) long (A). Before attempting to tow Cybertruck, always check the tow truck's recommended loading capacity against the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of Cybertruck (see Dimensions, Weights, and Cargo Capacity on page 221) to ensure that the flatbed truck is capable.

Activate Transport Mode before repositioning Cybertruck (if necessary) and winching it onto a flatbed tow truck. For more information, see Activate Transport Mode on page 229.

If Cybertruck has no low voltage power, attempt to jump start the low voltage system first so that you can then activate Transport Mode. For more information about jump starting, see If Vehicle Has No Power on page 228.

⚠️ CAUTION: Cybertruck uses steer-by-wire technology. As a result, you will be unable to use the steering wheel to turn the wheels if Cybertruck has no power.

NOTE: Do not transport Cybertruck with the front or rear wheels on dollies unless absolutely necessary for a short distance. If you are transporting Cybertruck on dollies, ensure that a steering wheel lock is applied and care is taken to prevent the front wheels from spinning.

⚠️ CAUTION: Before using dollies, check the manufacturer's specifications and recommended loading capacity against the vehicle weight rating and axle weight rating of Cybertruck, as specified by the vehicle certification label (see Vehicle Loading on page 218).

⚠️ CAUTION: DO NOT TRANSPORT YOUR VEHICLE IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE OF ANY OF THE WHEELS SPINNING.

⚠️ CAUTION: Tesla is not responsible for any damage caused by or during the transport of Cybertruck, including personal property damage or damage caused by using self-loading dollies or tire skates.

⚠️ WARNING: Cybertruck is equipped with high voltage and low voltage components that may be compromised as a result of a collision (see Electric Vehicle Components on page 173). Before transporting Cybertruck, it is important to assume these components are energized. Always follow high voltage safety precautions (wearing personal protection equipment, etc.) until emergency response professionals have evaluated the vehicle and can accurately confirm that all high voltage systems are no longer energized. Failure to do so may result in serious injury.

## If Vehicle Has No Power

If Cybertruck has no low voltage power:

1. Open the powered frunk. See Opening the Powered Frunk with No Power on page 236.
2. Jump start the low voltage battery. See Jump Starting on page 238.

Cybertruck must have low voltage power to open the doors from the outside or use the touchscreen.

⚠️ WARNING: It may be more difficult to steer Cybertruck when the vehicle is being supported by an external low voltage power supply. The wheels may not be as responsive to the steering wheel as expected, and extreme caution should be taken when repositioning Cybertruck.

228                                                                Owner's Manual

# Instructions for Transporters

## CAUTION: 
Cybertruck uses a 48V low voltage architecture. As a result, some functions may be unavailable or degraded if you are supporting Cybertruck with less than 30V (for example, another vehicle or a 12V portable jump starter).

## CAUTION: 
Avoid using low voltage components of Cybertruck (such as the climate control system, cabin USB-C ports, lights, etc.) when the vehicle is being supported by an external low voltage power supply. Doing so may disable low voltage systems and make it necessary to jump start Cybertruck again.

**NOTE:** Tow providers: If the vehicle ran out of range, see Running Out of Range on page 232 for more information on transporting the vehicle to a charging station and preparing the vehicle to charge.

If you are unable to jump start Cybertruck and the touchscreen is not accessible, use tire skates to re-position the rear tires, keeping front tires on the ground. When using tire skates, be sure to use skates of sufficient size to avoid contact between the tire and the bed/pavement. Before using tire skates, always check the manufacturer's specifications and recommended loading capacity.

## Disable the Self-Leveling Air Suspension System

**NOTE:** If Cybertruck has no low voltage power (or is being supported by an external low voltage power supply) you will not be able to enter Jack Mode.

Your Cybertruck is equipped with an air suspension system that automatically self-levels, even when the vehicle is "asleep" and the touchscreen is powered off. To prevent damage, you must activate Jack Mode to disable self-leveling:

1. Touch Controls > Ride and Handling on the touchscreen.
2. Press the brake pedal, and then touch Medium to maximize ride height.
3. Touch Controls > Service > Jack Mode.

**NOTE:** Jack Mode cancels if you touch the button again or when driving speed exceeds 4 mph (7 km/h).

## Activate Transport Mode

Transport Mode keeps the parking brake disengaged while winching Cybertruck onto a flatbed truck. When active, Transport Mode displays a message indicating that the vehicle will remain free-rolling. The following are required to enable Transport Mode:

- Low voltage power. If Cybertruck has no low voltage power, attempt to jump start the low voltage system so that you can use the touchscreen to activate Transport Mode (see If Vehicle Has No Power on page 228).
- Cybertruck must detect a key. Transport Mode is available only when a key is detected.

- Ensure the vehicle is not connected to a charger. Transport Mode is not available if Cybertruck is still plugged in.

To activate Transport Mode:

1. Ensure the vehicle is in Park and that it is not connected to a charge cable.
2. Chock the tires and make sure Cybertruck is secure.

   **WARNING:** Ensure that the wheels are secure and that Cybertruck has continuous low voltage support while it is in Transport Mode. If there is a loss of low voltage power (for example, if the low voltage battery does not self-recover before activating Transport Mode or if the external power supply becomes disconnected) there is a risk of rollaway.

3. Press and hold the brake pedal, and then on the touchscreen, touch Controls > Service > Towing. The touchscreen displays a message reminding you how to properly transport Cybertruck.

4. Touch Enter Transport Mode. The button turns blue to show that Cybertruck is now in Transport Mode. Cybertruck is now free-rolling and can be rolled slowly (no faster than walking speed) for short distances or winched (for example, onto a flatbed truck).

   **WARNING:** Power steering may be disabled when Cybertruck is in Transport Mode. The steering system may be less responsive and the steering wheel may be more difficult to turn. Use extreme caution when repositioning the wheels of Cybertruck while in Transport Mode.

To cancel Transport Mode, touch Exit Transport Mode or shift Cybertruck into Park. If your phone key is not detected, canceling Transport Mode powers off Cybertruck. You may need your key card to restart the vehicle.

**NOTE:** Transport Mode is only intended to allow for winching Cybertruck onto a flatbed truck or repositioning the vehicle out of a parking space. While in Transport Mode, the tires are allowed to rotate slowly (under 3 mph or 5 km/h) and for a very short distance (less than 30 feet or 10 meters). Exceeding these boundaries can lead to significant damage and overheating that is not covered by the warranty.

**NOTE:** If you are unable to activate Transport Mode (because, for example, the electrical system is not working and you are unable to jump start the low voltage system), use tire skates to reposition Cybertruck. Before doing so, always check the manufacturer's specifications and recommended loading capacity.

## Pull onto the Flatbed Truck From the Rear

To pull Cybertruck from the rear, use the tow hitch:

1. Chock the tires.

# Running Out of Range

CAUTION: It is your responsibility to monitor the state of the high voltage Battery and the remaining range of your vehicle. Do not assume that there is any range available when the range displayed on the touchscreen is at 0 miles (0 km) (or 0%). Damage to the low voltage battery due to running out of range is not covered by the warranty.

NOTE: Towing your vehicle as a result of running out of range is not covered by the warranty.

NOTE: In the unlikely event your vehicle runs out of range while driving, pull over when safe to do so and contact Tesla Roadside Assistance on page 231 or your preferred tow provider.

If Cybertruck runs out of range, the low voltage system is no longer supported – and when the low voltage battery runs out of power, the vehicle cannot charge. Therefore, the low voltage system must be supported by an external power supply to allow you to charge the High Voltage (HV) Battery. Once the vehicle begins charging, the external power supply is no longer required.

In the case of running out of range away from a charger, the tow provider should transport Cybertruck to the nearest charging station and unload the vehicle within the charging cable's reach. Once the vehicle is positioned next to a charger, follow these instructions:

NOTE: If the vehicle is being transported to a charger, make sure the tow provider does not leave until confirming that the vehicle's high voltage Battery is successfully charging.

1. Jump start the low voltage system (see Jump Starting on page 238). The low voltage battery must be jump started to support the high voltage Battery.

2. Wait a few minutes. Once the touchscreen powers on, plug the charge cable into Cybertruck to begin charging the high voltage Battery.

3. When Cybertruck begins to charge, disconnect the external power supply from the low voltage jump posts.

   WARNING: Shut off the external power supply before removing either cable. Removing the cables while the external power source is active may cause arcing.

NOTE: If Cybertruck is still not able to shift into Drive after charging the high voltage Battery, the low voltage battery may need additional time to recover. Reconnect the charge cable, wait several minutes, disconnect the charge cable, and then try again.

Before transporting to a non-Tesla charger, ensure your vehicle is equipped with an adapter that accommodates the specific type of charging station you will be using. Even at a non-Tesla charger, you will need to jump start the low voltage system before you can begin charging.

CAUTION: Always ensure Cybertruck has enough range for your drive, or for being stored for an extended period. Do not rely on the range estimates displayed on the touchscreen or mobile app as range can decrease faster than projected due to ambient temperature, driving habits, wind, vehicle settings (such as Sentry Mode), etc.

232                                                                Owner's Manual

# Opening the Powered Frunk with No Power

In the unlikely event that Cybertruck has no low voltage power, you will be unable to open the powered frunk using the touchscreen, mobile app, or powered frunk button.

It is necessary to open the powered frunk before attempting to jump start Cybertruck. For more information, see Jump Starting on page 238.

To open the powered frunk when Cybertruck has no power, you need a power source that provides between 9V and 16.5V (such as a 12V portable jump starter or another vehicle), or a power source that provides between 30V and 50V. A standard 9V battery may not have enough power to open the powered frunk if Cybertruck has no power. Instead, use a portable jump starter or another vehicle.

The steps below assume you are using an external low voltage power supply (such as a portable jump starter).

NOTE: The following steps do not open the powered frunk if Cybertruck is locked and has low voltage power.

1. Locate the front trunk access terminal beneath the front-left wheel well, behind the headlights.

2. Use your finger to loosen the cover, then pull it down and toward you to remove it and expose the terminals. The cover is attached to a loop of cable containing both the red positive (+) and the black negative (-) terminals.

3. Carefully pull the terminals out from the cavity.

4. Connect the low voltage power supply's red positive (+) cable to the red positive (+) terminal.

5. Connect the low voltage power supply's black negative (-) cable to the black negative (-) terminal.

[The document includes four images illustrating the steps:
1. An image showing the location of the front trunk access terminal
2. An image demonstrating how to remove the cover
3. An image showing the exposed terminals
4. An image illustrating the connection of positive and negative cables to the terminals]
---
# Opening the Powered Frunk with No Power

NOTE: Applying external low voltage power to these terminals only releases the hood latches. You cannot charge the low voltage battery using these terminals. Do not leave the low voltage power cables connected to the terminals for more than 30 seconds – remove from the vehicle's terminals as soon as the hood latches.

6. If you are using a variable power supply, set the supplied voltage to a value between 9V and 16.5V or between 30V and 50V.

7. Turn on the external power supply (refer to the manufacturer's instructions). The latches are immediately released and you can now open the powered frunk to access the front trunk area.

   CAUTION: If you are using a variable power supply, do not change the supplied voltage while the cables are connected.

8. Shut off the external power supply.

   WARNING: Shut off the external power supply before removing either cable. Removing the cables while the external power source is active may cause arcing.

9. Disconnect both cables, beginning with the black negative (-) cable.

10. Feed the terminals back into the cavity and then press the cover gently but firmly back into place to ensure that it is secured.

# Submerged Vehicle Guidance

Vehicle submersion can be caused by a flood or other extreme weather conditions. Tesla wants to ensure you have the resources should there be a risk of vehicle submersion or if your vehicle experiences submersion in water.

Review these recommendations to help prepare for a potential vehicle submersion, know how to handle a submerged vehicle, and find available resources.

## Best Practices to Prepare for Potential Flooding

If a submersion event is in the forecast and it is safe for you to preemptively move your vehicle, Tesla recommends you attempt to move Cybertruck to a location that is not at risk, or to higher ground. Keep in mind that charging infrastructure may be impacted, so Tesla recommends charging to 100% ahead of time.

However, if you are unable to move your vehicle to an area that is not at risk of flooding, consider the following best practices which may help prevent damage:

- Make sure to unplug the charger from your vehicle.
- Reduce the state of charge. This can be done by driving the vehicle ahead of time and leaving it unplugged, or by turning on climate controls or enabling Keep Climate On using your vehicle touchscreen or Tesla mobile app (see Operating Climate Controls on page 154). The intention is to have the charge level as low as possible if the vehicle becomes submerged.
- Change the air suspension (if equipped) and raise the vehicle height to High or Very High prior to leaving the vehicle.
- Lift the vehicle so that the high voltage Battery is above a potential flood line by raising it on jack stands, cylinder blocks, ramps, etc. Remember to enable Jack Mode with air suspension (if equipped) to avoid damage from self-leveling (see Jacking and Lifting on page 210).
- Leave Cybertruck in a water-tight car cover, or similar product, specifically designed to protect vehicles from flooding.

## Handling a Submerged Vehicle

Know what to do if your vehicle, whether it's an electric vehicle or internal combustion engine vehicle, has been exposed to prolonged submersion.

> WARNING: If you notice fire, smoke, audible popping/hissing or heating coming from your vehicle, step away and immediately contact your local first responders.

Follow these steps once the vehicle is no longer submerged and is safe to access:

1. Treat your vehicle as if it has been in an accident and contact your insurance company.

2. Do not attempt to operate the vehicle until an authorized shop has inspected it. If you are a Tesla vehicle owner, you can schedule your inspection with Tesla Service.

3. Safely tow the vehicle at least 50 feet (15 meters) from structures or other combustible materials such as other cars and personal property.
   - Tesla owners can request towing assistance from Tesla. See Contacting Tesla Roadside Assistance on page 231 for more information.
   - Refer to Instructions for Transporters on page 228 for information on how to safely tow or move your vehicle.

# Troubleshooting Alerts

One or more of the vehicle cameras has limited visibility, or no visibility at all, due to external conditions. When the cameras on your vehicle cannot provide accurate visual information, some or all Autopilot features may be temporarily unavailable.

Cameras may have limited or no visibility due to:

- Dirt or debris on the camera surface.
- Environmental conditions like rain, fog, snow, or dew.
- Bright sunlight or glare from another light source.
- Low or limited light conditions, including unlit or poorly lit roadways at night.
- Condensation (water droplets or mist) on the camera surface.
- Monotonous environmental features, including tunnel walls or highway dividers.

## What to do:

Continue to your destination. Your vehicle is OK to drive. This is often a temporary issue that will be resolved when condensation evaporates, or when a particular environmental condition or feature is no longer present.

If the alert does not clear by the time you reach your destination, check camera surfaces for condensation, dirt, or other debris. For camera locations, see Cameras on page 27.

Clean the cameras as necessary before your next planned drive. For recommended cleaning procedures, see Cleaning a Camera on page 28.

If you continue to see this alert after cleaning the cameras, check the inside surfaces of the door pillar camera enclosures for condensation. Although condensation inside the camera enclosures cannot be wiped clean, you can usually clear it faster by following these steps:

1. Precondition the cabin by turning Climate ON, setting temperature to High, and making sure A/C is ON.
2. Turn on the front windshield defroster.
3. Direct the air vents toward the door pillar cameras.

For more information on clearing condensation from camera enclosures, see Cleaning a Camera on page 28.

If the alert does not clear by the end of your next planned drive, despite cleaning the indicated camera(s) and following recommended steps to clear condensation, schedule service at your next convenient opportunity. Your vehicle is OK to drive in the meantime.

# Troubleshooting Alerts

Your vehicle's speed and power will be limited. Your vehicle will gradually lose all drive torque, and you must pull over.

After you have pulled over and shifted into Park (P), you will have the option to drive again. Your vehicle will be limited to a very low speed for emergency operation, such as repositioning your vehicle before it is towed.

## What to do:

Pull over at a safe location, and bring your vehicle to a complete stop, at your earliest reasonable opportunity.

Once your vehicle is in Park (P) with the parking brake applied, you may choose to accept the stated conditions in the message displayed on the touchscreen and shift out of Park (P). Your vehicle's speed and power will be very limited. This limited drive torque will allow you to reposition your vehicle slightly at the parked location or prepare your vehicle to be towed, but your vehicle should not be driven on public roads in this condition.

It is possible that exiting and re-entering your vehicle may clear the alert and restore functionality. If you attempt this successfully, and no further alert messages display in the touchscreen indicating potential electrical or steering system issues, or inability to drive, continue to your destination.

If this alert occurs again during your next drive, or occurs multiple times over subsequent drives, it is recommended that you schedule service.

# Disclaimers

## Event Data Recorder (EDR)

Cybertruck is equipped with an event data recorder (EDR). The main purpose of an EDR is to record, in certain crash or near crash-like situations, data such as an airbag deployment or hitting a road obstacle, to better understand how the vehicle's systems performed. The EDR is designed to record data related to vehicle dynamics and safety systems for a short period of time, typically 30 seconds or less. The EDR in Cybertruck is designed to record data such as:

- How various systems in your vehicle were operating;
- Whether or not the driver and passenger safety belts were buckled/fastened;
- How far (if at all) the driver was pressing the accelerator and/or brake pedal; and,
- How fast the vehicle was traveling.

The data can help provide a better understanding of the circumstances in which crashes and injuries occur.

NOTE: EDR data is recorded by your vehicle only if a non-trivial crash situation occurs; no data is recorded by the EDR under normal driving conditions and no personal data (for example, name, gender, age, and crash location) is recorded. However, other parties, such as law enforcement, could combine the EDR data with person identifying data they routinely acquire during a crash investigation.

To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is required, and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed. In addition to the vehicle manufacturer, other parties, such as law enforcement, that have this special equipment, can read the information if they have access to the vehicle or the EDR. Tesla may also access the EDR remotely in some crash circumstances.

## Vehicle Telematics

Cybertruck is equipped with electronic modules that monitor and record data from various vehicle systems, including the motor, Autopilot components, Battery, braking and electrical systems. The electronic modules record information about various driving and vehicle conditions, including braking, acceleration, trip and other related information regarding your vehicle. These modules also record information about the vehicle's features such as charging events and status, the enabling/disabling of various systems, diagnostic trouble codes, VIN, speed, direction and location.

The data is stored by the vehicle and may be accessed, used and stored by Tesla service technicians during vehicle servicing or periodically transmitted to Tesla wirelessly through the vehicle's telematics system. This data may be used by Tesla for various purposes, including, but not limited to: providing you with Tesla telematics services; troubleshooting; evaluation of your vehicle's quality, functionality and performance; analysis and research by Tesla and its partners for the improvement and design of our vehicles and systems; to defend Tesla; and as otherwise may be required by law. In servicing your vehicle, Tesla can potentially resolve issues remotely simply by reviewing your vehicle's data log.

Tesla's telematics system wirelessly transmits vehicle information to Tesla on a periodic basis. The data is used as previously described and helps ensure the proper maintenance of your vehicle. Additional Cybertruck features may use your vehicle's telematics system and the information provided, including features such as charging reminders, software updates, and remote access to, and control of, various systems of your vehicle.

Tesla does not disclose the data recorded in your vehicle to any third party except when:

- An agreement or consent from the vehicle's owner (or the leasing company for a leased vehicle) is obtained.
- Officially requested by the police or other authorities.
- Used as a defense for Tesla.
- Ordered by a court of law.
- Used for research purposes without disclosing details of the vehicle owner or identification information.
- Disclosed to a Tesla affiliated company, including their successors or assigns, or our information systems and data management providers.

For additional information regarding how Tesla processes data collected from your vehicle, please review Tesla's Privacy Notice at http://www.tesla.com/about/legal.

## Data Sharing

For quality assurance and to support the continuous improvement of advanced features such as Autopilot, your Cybertruck may collect analytics, road segment, diagnostic, and vehicle usage data and send to Tesla for analysis. This analysis helps Tesla improve products and services by learning from the experience of billions of miles that Tesla vehicles have driven. Although Tesla shares this data with partners that contribute similar data, the collected information does not identify you personally and can be sent to Tesla only with your explicit consent. In order to protect your privacy, personal information is either not logged at all, is subject to privacy preserving techniques, or is removed from any reports before being sent to Tesla. You have control over what data you share by touching Controls > Software > Data Sharing.

For additional information regarding how Tesla processes data collected from your vehicle, please review Tesla's Privacy Notice at http://www.tesla.com/about/legal.

NOTE: Although Cybertruck uses GPS in connection with driving and operation, as discussed in this document, Tesla does not record or store vehicle-specific GPS information, except the location where a crash occurred. Consequently, Tesla is unable to provide historical information about a vehicle's location (for example, Tesla is unable to tell you where Cybertruck was parked/traveling at a particular date/time).
