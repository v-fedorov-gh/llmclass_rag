      "Answer: If you're having trouble with Supercharging in the cold, it might be the charge port latch freezing. Try using the Defrost Truck feature in your Tesla Mobile App to defrost your vehicle for about 30 to 45 minutes. Alternatively, warming up the side mirrors via the vehicle touchscreen can help, as this will activate the charge port inlet heater. If the charge cable still can't be removed, try the charge port manual release.\n",
