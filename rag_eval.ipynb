      "\n",
      "- To reduce the temperature in the cabin in hot weather conditions, the fan may turn on to vent the cabin when the vehicle is parked. This occurs only if the Battery's charge level is above 20%.\n",
      "\n",
      "- In addition to cooling the interior, the air conditioning compressor also cools the Battery. Therefore, in hot weather, the air conditioning compressor can turn on even if you turned it off. This is normal because the system's priority is to cool the Battery to ensure it stays within an optimum temperature range to support longevity and optimum performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Even when not in use, you may hear Cybertruck emit a whining noise or the sound of water circulating. These sounds are normal and occur when the internal cooling systems turn on to support various vehicle functions, such as maintaining the low voltage battery and balancing the temperature of the high voltage Battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "- In very humid conditions, it is normal for the windshield to fog slightly when you first turn on the air conditioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "- It is normal for a small pool of water to form under Cybertruck when parked. Extra water produced by the dehumidifying process is drained underneath.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips:\n",
      "\n",
      "- If the climate control system is louder than you prefer, manually reduce the fan speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Improve the efficiency of the cabin heating or cooling by reducing your rate of acceleration. This allows the heat pump system to take more heat from the Battery to efficiently heat the cabin, instead of maintaining the Battery's ability to provide peak acceleration performance. Note that when subsequently increasing the acceleration mode, the Battery requires time to warm up before the increased level of acceleration is available.\n",
      "\n",
      "- To ensure the climate control system operates efficiently, close all windows and ensure that the exterior grille in front of the windshield is free of ice, snow, leaves, and other debris.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Your charge port latch may freeze in extremely cold weather or icy conditions. In cases where you cannot remove or insert the charge cable, or your vehicle is not Supercharging due to the latch being frozen in place, enable Defrost Truck in the mobile app. This helps thaw ice on the charge port latch so the charge cable can be removed or inserted. See Cold Weather Best Practices on page 160 for more information.\n",

Accordingly, when the low tire pressure telltale illuminates, you should stop and check your tires as soon as possible, and inflate them to the proper pressure. Driving on a significantly under-inflated tire causes the tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure. Under-inflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tire tread life, and may affect the vehicle's handling and stopping ability.\n",

      "\n",
      "Airbags inflate when sensors detect an impact that exceeds deployment thresholds. These thresholds are designed to predict the severity of a crash in time for the airbags to help protect the vehicle's occupants. Airbags inflate instantly with considerable force accompanied by a loud noise. The inflated bag, together with the seat belts, limits movement of occupants to reduce the risk of injury.\n",

When driving with a child seat on the front passenger seat (if permitted in your market region), always double-check the status of the passenger front airbag to confirm that it is OFF.\n",
      "\n",
      "Front airbags are not ordinarily designed to inflate in rear collisions, rollovers, side collisions and when braking heavily or driving over bumps and potholes. Likewise, front airbags may not inflate in all frontal collisions, such as minor front collisions, underride collisions, or minor impacts with narrow objects (such as posts or poles). Significant superficial damage can occur to the vehicle without the airbags inflating and, conversely, a relatively small amount of structural damage can cause airbags to inflate. Therefore, the external appearance of the vehicle after a collision does not represent whether or not the front airbags should have inflated.\n",
      "\n",
      "To protect an adult occupying the front passenger seat, ensure the passenger front airbag is ON – when ON, a Passenger Airbag OFF icon should not be visible on the touchscreen. When the passenger airbag is ON, it may inflate when a collision occurs.\n",
